```

|  Gold (GP)        |   10 SP                  |

```

## Banknotes

### Fresh and Iron Rations
Fresh rations are generally fresh produce, meat, bread, and similar foods 
which spoil 7 days after purchase. Iron rations are made of ingredients such as 
travel bread, fruit preserves, fruit leather, jerky, potted meat, noodles, and 
pemican. Iron rations are generally shelf stable for multiple months at a time.

### Medical Kit
A kit filled with gauze, scissors, bandages, salves, and other medicinal gear. 
Has 10 charges. When you use this kit on yourself or another creature, make a 
medicine check to determine the outcome.
```
|  Roll        |  Outcome                   |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| 1 or less    | Takes 1d4 piercing damage. |
| 2-5          | No effect.                 |
| 6-10         | Stabilized if not already. |
| 11-15        | Heals 1d4 hit points.      |
| 16-20        | Heal 1d6 hit points.       |
| 21 or higher | Heal 1d8 hit points.       |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
```

### Flask of oil
A flask of oil can be thrown to create a 5ft puddle or soak an enemy. If lit, 
an oil-soaked creature takes 1d8+2 fire damage, and 1d6 fire damage on each 
subsequent turn until extinguished. A creature that starts it's turn in or 
enters a fire makes a DC 14 DEX save to avoid 1d6 fire damage.

### Potion of Healing
A flask of pink liquid which heals 2d4+2 hit points when consumed.

### Caltrops
You may drop caltrops over a space of four 5ft squares that are connected. 
When you do, any creature who enters that space must make a DC 14 dex save. 
On a failure, the creature receives 1 piercing damage and their movement is 
reduced to 0. A creature who moves carefully treats the square as difficult 
terrain and rolls normally. A creature who moves normally rolls with 
disadvantage.

# Armors
Adventuring is a dangerous job, remember to wear a helmet!

| --------------- | -------- | ------------------------- | --------- | -------- | ------------ | ------ |
```

### Armor Sizing
Many characters may have more extreme sizes, meaning they cannot equip armor 
unless it is specificially designed for them, requiring a different amount of 
materials. For each size above medium multiply the cost by X + 1 where "X" is 
the number of sizes above medium. For each size below small, multiply the cost
by 1/(X+1) where "X" is the number of sizes lower than medium.

### Putting on and taking off armor
It takes time to don and doff armor, you only recieve the effects of a set of
armor after it has been fully donned. 
```
|  Category    |  Don       |  Doff     |
| ------------ | ---------- | --------- |
| Light Armor  | 1 minute   | 1 minute  |
| Medium Armor | 5 minutes  | 1 minute  |
| Heavy Armor  | 10 minutes | 5 minutes |
| Shield       | 1 action   | 1 action  |
| ------------ | ---------- | --------- |

### Weapon Sizing
Many characters may have more extreme sizes, meaning they cannot utilize weapons 
unless they are specificially designed for them, requiring a different amount of 
materials. For each size above medium multiply the cost and damage die of these 
weapons by X + 1 where "X" is the number of sizes above medium. For each size 
below small, multiply the cost by 1/(X+1) where "X" is the number of sizes lower 
than medium. 

## Weapon properties

### Ammunition
Weapons with the ammunition property require ammunition to make ranged attacks. 
Each attack expends one piece of ammunication. Retrieving the ammunition is part
of the attack. You can recover half your expended ammunication by spending one 
minute to search the battlefield. When you use a weapon with the ammunition 
property to make a melee attack, it's treated as an improvised weapon.

### Finesse
Attacks with this weapon can use your choice of strength or dexterity modifier 
for the attack and damage rolls, and both rolls must use the same modifier.

### Heavy
Small creatures receive disadvantage on Attack rolls with heavy weapons.

### Light
When you make an attack with a light weapon in one hand, you may use your bonus 
action to make an attack using a light weapon in another hand. This attack's 
damage does not benefit from your ability modifier.

### Loading
Each time you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to make an attack with a 
weapon posessing the loading property, you can only fire once, regardless of how 
many attacks you have.

### Range
A ranged weapon has a range specified in parentheses after the ammunition or 
thrown property. The first number in the range is the normal range in feet, and 
the second is the weapon's long range. Attacking beyond normal range confers 
disadvantage on the attack roll. You cannot make attacks beyond the long range.

### Reach
This weapon gains an additional 5 feet of range when attacking, as well as 
determining reach for opportunity attacks.

### Special
This weapon has unique properties delivered by name in the special weapons 
section below.

### Thrown
You can throw thrown weapons to make a ranged Attack. You use the same modifier 
for the thrown attack as you would make for the melee attack.

### Two-handed
This weapon requirees both hands to make attacks unless you have a strength 
score of 22 or higher.

### Versatile
This weapon can be used with one hand, or with two hands. The two-handed damage 
value appears in parentheses after the property.

### Improvised Weapons
At the keeper's discretion, a an improvised weapon may be used to inflict more 
damage than an unarmed attack. If it resembles a weapon, such as a club, it may 
be used as such with the same damage, proficiency, and ability modifier. If it 
doesn't resemble a weapon, it deals at most 1d4 damage, has a normal range of 20 
feet and a long range of 60 feet.

### Silvered Weapons
One silvered weapon or ten pieces of silvered ammunition generally costs 100gp. 
They perform identically to their normal counterparts, with the exception that 
some enemies are weak to silver.

### Stagger
This weapon is capable of staggering opponents, when you hit a creature no more
than one size larger than you they must make a stagger check as outlined in the
core rules.

### Special Weapons

#### Lance: 
Attacks within 5 feet have disadvantage. The weapon requires two hands 
when you're not mounted.

#### Net: 
Creatures large or smaller are restrained when hit by a net until freed. 
Breaking out requires a DC 11 strength check. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the 
net (AC 10) destroyes the net, ending the restrained effect. When you use an 
action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one 
attack regardless of how many attacks you otherwise have.
