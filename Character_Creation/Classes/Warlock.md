### Warlock Pact
As a warlock your spellcasting ability is granted to you by a patron whom you 
have made a magically binding pact with. You may attempt to commune with them
your GM allows, and you MUST obey ANY demands your patron asks of you, or they
may consider taking back your magic. Choose one patron from the following and
refer to the end of this document for what the benefits of each are.

- Devil
- Demon
- Celestial

### Pact Casting
You are capable of casting spells thanks to your otherworldy pact. Your casting
modifier for these spells is charisma. when a spell refers to a saving throw the
DC is 8 + Your Proficiency Bonus + Your Charisma Modifier. At level 1 you learn
3 cantrips from the warlock spell list and each level after that you learn one
leveled spell of your maximum spell level or lower. 

Your mortal mind is incapable of properly comprehending the vast magical ability
granted by your otherworldly patron, putting you at risk of being pushed to the 
brink of madness and insanity. Whenever you cast a spell make a will roll 
against the difficulty class of the spell level specified on the chart below. On
a failure remove the associated amount of sanity.

```

|  Spell Level  |  DC   |  Sanity Drain  |
| ------------- | ----- | -------------- |
|  1st          |  12   |  1             |
|  2nd          |  14   |  2             |
|  3rd          |  16   |  4             |
| ------------- | ----- | -------------- |

```

If your sanity (outlined in [CoreRules.md](https://github.com/ErinaTheDummy/SwordToShield/blob/main/CoreRules.md#sanity)) ever drops to 0 you become
posessed by your patron for 1 hour, who uses your body as a vessel to exhert 
their will, after which time you regain control of your body with 1 sanity.  

### Hitpoint Increase
Your hitpoints increase by 1d6 + your constitution modifier.

### Hitpoint re-roll
Roll 2d6+6 and add 3 times your constitution modifier. If the result is 
higher than your current maximum that becomes your new hitpoint maximum. You may
repeat this every time you level up.

### Ability Score Increase
You may increase one of your ability scores by 2 or two of them by 1. You may 
forgo your ability score increase and take a feat instead.

### Invocations
Your patron offers you invocations to passively strengthen you or grant you
abilities that you would not have otherwise. Refer to the warlock invocations
column of the warlock level chart to determine how many invocations you should
have at a given level.
