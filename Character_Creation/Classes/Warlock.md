### Warlock Pact
As a warlock your spellcasting ability is granted to you by a patron whom you 
have made a magically binding pact with. You may attempt to commune with them
your GM allows, and you MUST obey ANY demands your patron asks of you, or they
may consider taking back your magic. Choose one patron from the following and
refer to the end of this document for what the benefits of each are.

- Devil
- Demon
- Celestial

### Pact Casting
You are capable of casting spells thanks to your otherworldy pact. Your casting
modifier for these spells is charisma. when a spell refers to a saving throw the
DC is 8 + Your Proficiency Bonus + Your Charisma Modifier. At level 1 you learn
3 cantrips from the warlock spell list and each level after that you learn one
leveled spell of your maximum spell level or lower. 

Your body is incapable of properly containing all the magical ability of your 
patron, putting you at risk of corruption when you cast leveled spells. When you 
cast a spell that does not require a spell attack, roll 1d20. If the spell you 
cast refers to a spell attack, simply use the natural roll of the attack rather 
than rolling another 20 sided die. Refer to the following chart to determine the
threshold and stakes of each level of spell.

```

|  Spell Level  |  Treshhold  |  Corruption Chart Roll  |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------------------- |
|  1st          |  2          |  Roll Neutral           |
|  2nd          |  3          |  Roll Minor Detrimental |
|  3rd          |  4          |  Roll Bad               |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------------------- |

```
Do note that if you roll below the threshold and are corrupted you may instead 
drop to 1 hitpoint and attempt your d20 roll again, with there being no 
corruptive effect on a high enough roll. Refer to the end of this document for
the warlock corruption charts.

### Hitpoint Increase
Your hitpoints increase by 1d6 + your constitution modifier.

### Hitpoint re-roll
Roll 2d6+6 and add 3 times your constitution modifier. If the result is 
higher than your current maximum that becomes your new hitpoint maximum. You may
repeat this every time you level up.

### Ability Score Increase
You may increase one of your ability scores by 2 or two of them by 1. You may 
forgo your ability score increase and take a feat instead.
