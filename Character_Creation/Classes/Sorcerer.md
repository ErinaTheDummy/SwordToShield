### Supernatural Origin
Your sorcerous powers originate from somewhere, be it through being touched by
a god or through a connection to another realm, pick one sorcerous origin from
the following:

- Corrupted
- Unfathomable
- Fireborne

the specific features of each supernatural origin may be found at the end of
this document.

### Mana Casting
You have the ability to alter the magic at its source, energy that flows through 
all of creation creating magical effects, Mana. You have a pool of mana which
refills every time you rest. You may expend amounts of mana in order to cast
spells. Refer to the max mana points column of the sorcerer level chart to 
determine how much mana is at your disposal at a given level. You may cast a 
spell without using mana, but you must roll a mana check. If you roll equal to 
or less than the mana cost of the spell roll a 1d4-1, rerolling on a 1. On a sum 
of 1 roll on the "Bad Corruptions" table. On a sum of 2 roll on the  
"Minor Detrimental Corruptions" table. On a sum of 3 roll on the 
"Good Corruptions" chart. Refer to the following chart for the mana cost of
different spell levels:

```

|  Spell Level  |  Mana Cost  |
| ------------- | ----------- |
|  Cantrip      |  1          |
|  1            |  2          |
|  2            |  4          |
|  3            |  8          |
|  4            |  16         |
|  5            |  32         |
|  6            |  64         |
| ------------- | ----------- |

``` 
You learn 2 cantrips and 3 first level spells from the sorcerer spell list. You 
learn 1 spell from the sorcerer spell list each time you level up. A sorcerer 
who knows a spell that you do not may teach you that spell over the course of
one week.

### Hitpoint Increase
Your hitpoints increase by 1d4 + your constitution modifier.

### Sorcery Techniques
You have gained an intermediate level of skill with spellcasting, and begin to 
find ways to mix up your spells or cast them differently. You learn two sorcery
techniques. Refer to the sorcery techniques column of the sorcerer level chart
to determine how many sorcery techniques you know at a given level. You may
learn one additional sorcery technique from a sorcerer who spends 14 days 
training you on how to do it.

### Hitpoint re-roll
Roll 3d4 and add 3 times your constitution modifier. If the result is 
higher than your current maximum that becomes your new hitpoint maximum 

### Ability Score Increase
You may increase one of your ability scores by 2 or two of them by 1. You may 
forgo your ability score increase and take a feat instead.

### Epic Spells
You are capable of casting 6th level spells, Spells which are so strong that
they incur great physical toll. When you cast a 6th level spell, you lose the
ability to cast spells for 1d4 * 7 days. You may not cast a 6th level spell more
than once in a year.
