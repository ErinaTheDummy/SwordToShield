### Supernatural Origin
Your sorcerous powers originate from somewhere, be it through being touched by
a god or through a connection to another realm, pick one sorcerous origin from
the following:

- Corrupt Soul
- Eldritch Heart
- Fireborne

the specific features of each supernatural origin may be found at the end of
this document.

### Mana Casting
You have the ability to alter reality using magic at its most basic level, 
energy that flows through all of creation creating magical effects: Mana. You 
have a pool of mana which refills every time you rest, and you may expend 
amounts of mana in order to cast spells. Your casting modifier for these spells 
is constitution. when a spell refers to a saving throw the DC is 8 + Your 
Proficiency Bonus + Your Constitution Modifier. Refer to the max mana points 
column of the sorcerer level chart to determine how much mana is at your 
disposal at a given level. 

You may cast a spell without using mana, but you must roll a mana check 
against the save DC of the level of spell you are casting to attempt to avoid 
corruption. If you roll a mana check lower than the DC of the spell level you 
must roll a on the corruptions chart listed for that spell level. Refer to the 
following chart for the mana cost and manaless casting DC of different spell 
levels:

```

|  Spell Level  |  Mana Cost  |  Save DC  |  Chart Type     |
| ------------- | ----------- | --------- | --------------- |
|  Cantrip      |  1          |  6        |  negligible     |
|  1            |  2          |  8        |  negligible     |
|  2            |  4          |  10       |  minor det      |
|  3            |  8          |  14       |  minor det      |
|  4            |  16         |  17       |  Bad            |
|  5            |  32         |  18       |  Bad            |
|  6            |  48         |  26       |  Instant Death  |
| ------------- | ----------- | --------- | --------------- |

``` 

At level 1 You learn 2 cantrips and 3 first level spells from the sorcerer spell
list. Each time you level up you learn a spell of a level you are capable of 
casting using mana, no more than 5th level, from the sorcerer spell list. A 
sorcerer who knows a spell that you do not may teach you that spell over the 
course of one week.

### Hitpoint Increase
Your hitpoints increase by 1d4 + your constitution modifier.

### Sorcery Techniques
You have gained an intermediate level of skill with spellcasting, and begin to 
find ways to mix up your spells or cast them differently. You learn two sorcery
techniques. Refer to the sorcery techniques column of the sorcerer level chart
to determine how many sorcery techniques you know at a given level. You may
learn one additional sorcery technique from a sorcerer who spends 14 days 
training you on how to do it.

### Hitpoint re-roll
Roll 2d4+4 and add 3 times your constitution modifier. If the result is 
higher than your current maximum that becomes your new hitpoint maximum. You may
repeat this every time you level up.

### Ability Score Increase
You may increase one of your ability scores by 2 or two of them by 1. You may 
forgo your ability score increase and take a feat instead.

### Epic Spells
You are capable of casting 6th level spells, Spells which are so strong that
they incur great physical toll. When you cast a 6th level spell, you lose the
ability to cast spells for 1d4 * 7 days. You may not cast a 6th level spell more
than once in a year.
