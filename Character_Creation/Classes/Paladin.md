### Chivalrous Order

### Grace Casting
You are capable of casting spells using an energy called "grace" alotted to you
by your god. Your casting modifier for grace casting is wisdom or charisma 
(your choice), and when a spell refers to a saving throw the DC is equal to 8 + Your proficiency bonus + Your
wisdom modifier. Refer to the following chart for the grace cost of each spell
level:

```

|  Spell Level  |  Grace Cost  |
| ------------- | ------------ |
|  Cantrip      |  2           |
|  1            |  20          |
|  2            |  80          |
|  3            |  240         |
| ------------- | ------------ |

``` 
In order to cast spells you must prepare them. You may prepare a number of 
spells equal to your paladin level + your wisdom or charisma modifier from the 
paladin spell list by praying each rest. You also learn 2 cantrips from the 
paladin spell list. When you cast a spell it consumes an amount of grace equal 
to its grace cost.

gain it through many means. The following charts show actions that will increase

| ------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ----------------------------- |

```

higher than your current maximum that becomes your new hitpoint maximum. You may
