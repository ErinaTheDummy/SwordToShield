### Shifting
As a bonus action you may transform into your monstrous form, granting you an 
increase to your stats and access to natural weapons. When you transform you may
expend up to 5 hit dice and roll that same number of monstrous form dice, adding
your health when not shifted, to determine your HP while turned. You may also 
take the average (rounded up) instead. Your shift lasts for a number of minutes 
equal to the amount of hit dice expended. When your shift ends you return to 
your original hitpoints or stay at your current hitpoints, whichever number is
lower.

### Monstrous Form
Your monstrous form is the form you change into when shifting. Your monstrous 
form grants you special features. Choose one monstrous form from the following:

- Desmoduthrope
- Lycanthrope

Refer to the list at the end of this document to find the exact features granted 
to you by your monstrous form.

### Unwilling Shift
You will occassionally encounter situations wherein you lose control of yourself
to the affilction that grants you your abilities. These outbursts are extremely
deadly. When you encounter a trigger for an unwilling shift, as described by 
your monstrous form, you must make a wisdom saving throw against its DC or give 
in, transforming for an hour or until you succeed a wisdom saving throw against
the DC or become hostile and fall under the control of your GM. You may repeat 
this saving throw every 60 seconds and you may expend a hit die to give yourself 
advantage on the saving throw. When you resist an unwilling shift you are immune
to unwilling shifts for an hour.

### Hitpoint Increase
Your hitpoints increase by 1d4 + your constitution modifier.

### Hitpoint re-roll
Roll 3d4 and add 3 times your constitution modifier. If the result is 
higher than your current maximum that becomes your new hitpoint maximum

### Ability Score Increase
You may increase one of your ability scores by 2 or two of them by 1. You may 
forgo your ability score increase and take a feat instead.

### Form Resistance
You gain resistance to non-magical non-silvered bludgeoning, piercing, and 
slashing damage while in your monstrous form. 

### Extra Attack
When you take the attack action, you may make two attacks instead of one.
