### Shifting
As a bonus action you may transform into your monstrous form, granting you an 
increase to your stats and access to natural weapons. When you transform you may
expend up to 5 hit dice and roll that same number of monstrous form dice, adding
your maximum health when not shifted, to determine your maximum HP while turned.
Your shift lasts for a number of minutes equal to the amount of hit dice 
expended or until you drop to 0 hitpoints. When your shift ends you return to 
your original hitpoints or stay at your current hitpoints, whichever number is 
lower; your maximum hitpoints return to normal irregardless of your current 
hitpoints. Your hitpoints at the beginning of a shift are equal to the maximum 
hitpoint amount you rolled. 

### Monstrous Form
Your monstrous form is the form you change into when shifting. Your monstrous 
form grants you special features. Choose one monstrous form from the following:

- Desmoduthrope
- Lycanthrope
- Ursusthrope

Refer to the list at the end of this document to find the exact features granted 
to you by your monstrous form.

### Unwilling Shift
You will occassionally encounter situations where you lose control of yourself
to the affilction that grants you your abilities, these outbursts are extremely
deadly. When you encounter a trigger for an unwilling shift, as described by 
your monstrous form, you must make a wisdom saving throw against its DC or 
experience an unwilling shift. You may expend a hit die to have advantage on
a saving throw against an unwilling shift.

At the beginning of an unwilling shift, roll your maximum possible amount of 
monstrous form dice and add your maximum hitpoints, this is your maximum and 
starting hp for this unwilling shift. An unwilling shift lasts for 1 hour or 
until you drop to 0 hitpoints. You may repeat the saving throw once every 
minute, ending the shift early on a success.

Your GM takes control of your character for the entire duration of your 
unwilling shift, otherwise it is identical to a regular shift.

### Hitpoint Increase
Your hitpoints increase by 1d4 + your constitution modifier.

### Hitpoint re-roll
Roll 3d4 and add 3 times your constitution modifier. If the result is 
higher than your current maximum that becomes your new hitpoint maximum

### Ability Score Increase
You may increase one of your ability scores by 2 or two of them by 1. You may 
forgo your ability score increase and take a feat instead.

### Form Resistance
You gain resistance to non-magical non-silvered bludgeoning, piercing, and 
slashing damage while in your monstrous form. 

### Extra Attack
When you take the attack action, you may make two attacks instead of one.
