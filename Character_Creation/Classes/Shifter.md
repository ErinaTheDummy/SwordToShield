### Shifting
As a bonus action you may transform into your monstrous form, granting you an 
increase to your stats and access to natural weapons. When you transform you may
expend up to 5 hit dice. Your shift lasts for a number of minutes equal to the 
amount of hit dice  expended or until you drop to or below 0 hitpoints. When 
your shift ends you return to your original hitpoints or stay at your current 
hitpoints, whichever number is lower; your maximum hitpoints return to normal 
irregardless of your current hitpoints. Your hitpoint maximum at the beginning 
of a shift is equal to the maximum roll of your monstrous form dice, times how 
many hit dice you expended, plus your unshifted HP, you start your shift at full 
hp.

### Monstrous Form
Your monstrous form is the form you change into when shifting. Your monstrous 
form grants you special features. Choose one monstrous form from the following:

- Desmoduthrope
- Norvegthrope (norvegicus)
- Lycanthrope
- Ursusthrope

Refer to the list at the end of this document to find the exact features granted 
to you by your monstrous form.

### Unwilling Shift
You will occassionally encounter situations where you lose control of yourself
to the affilction that grants you your abilities, these outbursts are extremely
deadly. When you encounter a trigger for an unwilling shift, as described by 
your monstrous form, you must make a wisdom saving throw against its DC or 
experience an unwilling shift. You may expend a hit die to have advantage on
a saving throw against an unwilling shift.

At the beginning of an unwilling shift, roll your maximum possible amount of 
monstrous form dice and add your maximum hitpoints, this is your maximum and 
starting hp for this unwilling shift. An unwilling shift lasts for 1 hour or 
until you drop to 0 hitpoints. You may repeat the saving throw once every 
minute, ending the shift early on a success.

Your GM takes control of your character for the entire duration of your 
unwilling shift, otherwise it is identical to a regular shift.

### Hitpoint Increase
Your hitpoints increase by 1d4 + your constitution modifier.

### Partial Shift
As a bonus action you may partially shift into your monstrous form for 1 minute.
During this partial shift you gain 10 temporary hitpoints, the stat increases 
associated with your form, one natural weapon, and one feature of your choice 
from your monstrous form. Once you partially shift you may not do so again until
you finish a rest. While partially shifted you have disadvantage on saving 
throws to resist unwilling shifts.

### Hitpoint re-roll
Roll 2d4+4 and add 3 times your constitution modifier. If the result is 
higher than your current maximum that becomes your new hitpoint maximum. You may
repeat this every time you level up.

### Ability Score Increase
You may increase one of your ability scores by 2 or two of them by 1. You may 
forgo your ability score increase and take a feat instead.

### Form Resistance
You gain resistance to non-magical non-silvered bludgeoning, piercing, and 
slashing damage while in your monstrous form. 

### Extra Attack
When you take the attack action, you may make two attacks instead of one.
