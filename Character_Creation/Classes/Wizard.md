```

### Glyph Casting
You are capable of casting spells using magical glyphs that corrospond to 
different forms of mana. Your casting modifier for casting is intelligence, 
when a spell refers to a saving throw the DC is equal to 8 + Your proficiency 
bonus + Your intelligence modifier. Refer to the following chart for the amount
of glyphs you must write for each spell:

```

|  Spell Level  |  Glyphs Req  |
| ------------- | ------------ |
|  Cantrip      |  1           |
|  1            |  4           |
|  2            |  10          |
|  3            |  32          |
|  4            |  48          |
|  5            |  80          |
|  6            |  88 (Special)|
| ------------- | ------------ |

``` 

In order to prepare a spell you must know the glyphs used in its creation, and 
you must write exactly the amount noted for the spell level, as well as the 
spell you intend to cast with those glyphs.

Once you cast a spell using the glyphs you have written in your spellbook they
disappear. You may write more glyphs in your spellbook over the course of a
minute by expending an amount of hit die, and rolling them, adding your 
intelligence modifier to each roll, and writing the resulting number of glyphs 
in your spellbook. Refer to the maximum spell glyphs column of the wizard level 
chart to determine the maximum amount of glyphs you may have written in your 
spellbook at a given level.

### Learned Spells
You learn 3 cantrips and 4 first level spells from the wizard spell list. You 
learn 2 more spells from the wizard spell list of any spell level you are 
capable of casting each time you level up; this may not be a spell higher than
6th level, if you wish to learn those they must be found within the world your
character occupies. Due to the fact that you learn magic through study or by 
happenstance you may learn new spells by copying their glyphs into your 
spellbook. 

### Hitpoint Increase
Your hitpoints increase by 1d4 + your constitution modifier.

### Hitpoint re-roll
Roll 2d4+4 and add 3 times your constitution modifier. If the result is 
higher than your current maximum that becomes your new hitpoint maximum. You may
repeat this every time you level up. 

### Ability Score Increase
You may increase one of your ability scores by 2 or two of them by 1. You may 
forgo your ability score increase and take a feat instead.

### Wizard Speciality
You learn a technique in a special field of wizardry, allowing you to raise your
abilities to new horizons. Choose one wizard speciality. 

#### Wizard Speciality: Cantrip Master
You learn 2 cantrips from the wizard spell list. Rather than using one glyph to
inscribe one cantrip, you may now inscribe two of the same cantrip using only 
one glyph. You also roll an additional damage die when rolling damage for your 
cantrips.

#### Wizard Speciality: Battlecaster
You have hardened yourself for battle. Your hitpoint maximum increases by five.
You may inscribe special glyphs into a weapon or set of armor in order to grant
yourself proficiency with them, These glyphs occupy 4 of your maximum glyphs per
set of armor or weapon.

#### Wizard Speciality: Adept Scribe
When writing glyphs in your spellbook you may use a d10 in place of your d4 hit 
die for the purpose of rolling how many glyphs you write. You also learn 5 
wizard spells.

#### Wizard Speciality: Spellmaker
You create three special new spells of any spell level 4 or below and learn 
them. You are capable of preparing them as any other spell. Your GM must approve
these spells before you use them; if they do not then your head explodes the 
first time you attempt to cast one of the special spells, killing you instantly.

#### Wizard Speciality: Flexible Casting
You may write an amount of blank glyphs capable of casting one spell of a level
of your choice, without designating which spell. You may expend these glyphs to
cast one spell you know of the spell level you chose or lower. After you cast a
spell in this way you may not do so again until you complete a rest. You may 
also change the damage type of a spell to your choice from Acid, Fire, Cold,
Poison, Lightning, Thunder, or Force while casting it by replacing one of the 
glyphs in the spell as a free object interaction.

### Epic Spells
You are capable of casting 6th level spells, Spells which are so strong that
they incur great physical toll. When you cast a 6th level spell, you lose the
ability to cast spells for 1d4 * 7 days. You may not cast a 6th level spell more
than once in a year.
