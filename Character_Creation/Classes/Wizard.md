### Glyph Casting
You are capable of casting spells using magical glyphs that corrospond to 
different forms of mana. Your casting modifier for casting is intelligence, 
when a spell refers to a saving throw the DC is equal to 8 + Your proficiency 
bonus + Your intelligence modifier. Refer to the following chart for the amount
of glyphs you must write for each spell:

```

|  Spell Level  |  Glyphs Req  |
| ------------- | ------------ |
|  Cantrip      |  1           |
|  1            |  4           |
|  2            |  10          |
|  3            |  32          |
|  4            |  48          |
|  5            |  80          |
|  6            |  80 (Special)|
| ------------- | ------------ |

``` 

4 cantrips may fit into one glyph, and they may be cantrips of all different
types and amounts. In order to prepare a spell you must know the glyphs used in 
its creation, and you must write exactly the amount noted for the spell level, 
as well as the spell you intend to cast with those glyphs.

Once you cast a spell using the glyphs you have written in your spellbook they
disappear. You may write more glyphs in your spellbook over the course of a
minute by expending an amount of hit die, and rolling them, adding your 
intelligence modifier to each roll, and writing the resulting number of glyphs 
in your spellbook. Refer to the maximum spell glyphs column of the wizard level 
chart to determine the maximum amount of glyphs you may have written in your 
spellbook at a given level.

### Learned Spells
You learn 3 cantrips and 4 first level spells from the wizard spell list. You 
learn 2 more spells from the wizard spell list of any spell level you are 
capable of casting each time you level up. Due to the fact that you learn magic 
through study or by happenstance you may learn new spells by copying their 
glyphs into your spellbook.

### Hitpoint Increase
Your hitpoints increase by 1d4 + your constitution modifier.

### Hitpoint re-roll
Roll 3d4 and add 3 times your constitution modifier. If the result is 
higher than your current maximum that becomes your new hitpoint maximum 

### Ability Score Increase
You may increase one of your ability scores by 2 or two of them by 1. You may 
forgo your ability score increase and take a feat instead.

### Cantrip Increase
You learn 2 cantrips from the wizard spell list. You also may roll an additional
damage die when rolling damage for your cantrips.

### Epic Spells
You are capable of casting 6th level spells, Spells which are so strong that
they incur great physical toll. When you cast a 6th level spell, you lose the
ability to cast spells for 1d4 * 7 days. You may not cast a 6th level spell more
than once in a year.
