scrap needed to craft the item.

### Reloading

returning it to maximum capacity.

with an automatic weapon to fire 10 times wildly into an area 10 feet by 10 feet

take damage as if they were hit by an attack.

foot radis sphere centered on it. It may also be lit as an action and set to 
explode within up to 1 minute of lighting.

After speedloading a firearm, the speedloader becomes empty and must be reloaded
over the course of 1 minute before being used again.

capacity of six or fewer.

able to hold rifle bullets. The gun's damage die increases one size and its and
