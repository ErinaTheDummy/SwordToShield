### Psi
Psi is the energy of thought, a manifestation of will and mind taking control 
over matter. At the start of each of your turns you may expend a hit die and 
roll your psionic die/dice. The result of this roll is how much Psi you gain. 
Psi is a very feeble and fleeting kind of energy, if you have Psi at the start 
of your turn, from a previous turn, and you do not decide to expend a hit die 
and roll your psionic die, then the Psi you have stored up expires and resets to 
0.

### Psionics
Psionics are the practical applications of Psi energy. Psionics can be a range 
of things, from abilities to socially influence others, to methods of 
devastating psychic attack. At first level you know and are capable of utilizing 
3 psionics from the list of Psiker psionics, each time you level up you may swap 
any number of psionics out for different selections. Certain psionics may refer 
to a "Psonic DC" the formula for this DC is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your 
intelligence modifier. Refer to the Psionics Known column of the Psiker level 
chart to know how many psionics you have at a given level. 

### Empowered Psi 
Whenever you start your turn and choose to expend a hit die/dice to roll your 
psionic die, you may choose to expend an additional hit die and roll an 
additional die, meaning a psionic die of 1d8 would become 2d8; However psionic 
dice like 2d8 would simply become 3d8.

### Psionic Enhancement
Your psionic skill allows you to gain additional benefits when commanding Psi. 
Choose one psionic enhancement from the following:

#### Signature Psionic
Choose one psionic you know that requires 4 or less psi. You may use this 
Psionic without expending Psi, so long as you have at least 1 active Psi.

#### Psionic Fortitude
Whenever you roll your psionic die/dice for the first time after a rest, you 
gain temporary hitpoints equal to the roll. 

#### Immutable Mind
You gain immunity to the Frightened and charmed conditions and psychic damage 
while you have at least 1 active psi. 

# Psiker Psionics

### Lesser Telekinesis
As an action you may expend Psi to move one object within 100 feet to another

way take and deal bludgeoning damage proportional to their size. Creatures hit 
must make a dexterity saving throw against your Psionic DC to halve the damage 
```
+------------+-----------+----------+
| Size       | Psi Cost  | Prop Dam |
+------------+-----------+----------+
| Tiny       |     0     |     1    |
| Small      |     1     |    1d4   |
| Medium     |     2     |    1d8   |
| Large      |     3     |    1d12  |
