different features and abilities, choose one prophecy from the following:

plan, and combat accordingly. You are granted two revelations, refer to the 
revelations granted column of the prophet level chart to see how many 
revelations you have at a given level.

### Hitpoint increase

higher than your current maximum that becomes your new hitpoint maximum. You may
repeat this every time you level up.

forgo your ability score increase and take a feat instead.

few attacks, granting your attacks advantage until the end of your turn.

### Impending Attack
As a reaction to being targeted with an attack you may expend a hit die and jump 
out of the way causing attacks against you to have disadvantage until the start 
of your next turn. 

### Danger sense

fate innately knowing when danger is nearby.

within 60 feet of you, seeing how they will next be attacked and warning them.

### Holy Sense
As a bonus action you open your senses, smelling, tasting, seeing and feeling 
all of the battlefield. Until the start of your next turn you know the location 
of all unseen or invisible creatures within 120 feet of you and any creatures 
within that range may not benefit from being invisible or unseen by you.

showing them the way to navagate a world through great hardship which will 
surely approach.

which can only be described as the end of days, the fall of man, and the 
twilight of the gods. It is the solumn duty of an Annihilation prophet to break
the threads of fate which lead to this outcome.

### Forced Negation (Level 1)
Your knowledge of the threads of fate allow you to know when you're on the 
decline granting you the knowledge to turn failure into success. Whenever a 
creature making an attack against you has advantage to hit you may expend your 
reaction and 1 hit die to give them disadvantage instead. Additionally after 
each long rest you gain a number of temporary hitpoints equal to 5 + your 
prophet level which are removed next time you start a rest.
