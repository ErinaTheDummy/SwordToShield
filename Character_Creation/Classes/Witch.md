### Familiar
Familiars are the representation of the source of your magical powers, and they act as personal helpers. You are capable of seeing through your familiar, and you may conjure or abjure them as a bonus action. Your familiar has half as many maximum hitpoints as you and takes its turn immediately after yours. Your familiar is capable of casting any cantrips you know on their turn, may take any actions a player character could (other than attack), and has 10ft of walking speed and 30ft of additional flying, swimming, climbing or walking speed (your choice). If your familiar dies you must wait 1d4 hours before you can conjure it again. Your familiar is the link between you and your source of Magica.

### Magica
Magica is your casting resource, it is the raw magic alloted to you through your familiar. You start with 2 maximum magica, you regain 1d4 + your intelligence modifier magica every hour spent resting, or all of it over a long rest. You may expend magica to cast spells stored in your talismans.

### Talismans
Over the course of a long rest you may prepare a number of talismans equal to your level + your intelligence modifier. You may store one spell from the witch spell list within these talismans, and may expend magica through talismans to cast the stored spell. Non-witches may cast through talismans with your casting modifier and spell save DC by expending a number of hit dice equal to twice the level of the spell. Your casting modifier for casting is intelligence, when a spell refers to a saving throw the DC is equal to 8 + Your proficiency bonus + Your intelligence modifier. The magica cost of different leveled talismans are as follows:

```

|  Spell Level  |  Magica Cost  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|  1            |  1            |
|  2            |  2            |
|  3            |  4            |
|  4            |  8            |
|  5            |  12           |
|  6            |  Special      |
| ------------- | ------------- |

``` 

### Hitpoint Increase
Your hitpoints increase by 1d4 + your constitution modifier.

### Witching Path
The path you seek to power splits and forks, choose one witching path from the following:

- Familiar Bond
- Trinket Maker
- Hexer

### Hitpoint Re-roll
Roll 2d4+4 and add 3 times your constitution modifier. If the result is higher than your current maximum that becomes your new hitpoint maximum. You may repeat this every time you level up. 

### Witch Specialty
You learn a technique in a special field of witching, allowing you to raise your abilities to new horizons. Choose one Witch specialty. 

#### Witch Specialty: Cantrip Master
You learn 3 cantrips from the witch spell list. You also roll two additional damage die when rolling damage for your cantrips.

#### Witch Specialty: Battlecaster
You have hardened yourself for battle. Your hitpoint maximum increases by 14. You may turn a set of armor or a weapon into a special talisman, granting proficiency with the armor or weapon and allowing you to cast a cantrip of your choice through them. 

#### Witch Specialty: Spellmaker
You create three special new spells of any spell level 4 or below and learn them. You are capable of preparing them as any other spell. Alternatively you may create one spell of level 5. Your GM must approve these spell(s) before you use them; if they do not then your head explodes the first time you attempt to cast one of the special spells, killing you instantly. 

#### Witch Specialty: Boil & Bubble
Over the course of a rest you may expend up to 5 hit dice to make potions of healing, producing one potion of healing for each hit die you expend. When a creature consumes one of these potions they heal for 3d6 hitpoints and gain a +5 to their next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. These potions lose potency after 24 hours.

#### Witch Specialty: Witch of Blessing
Whenever you target a creature with an effect that heals, gives temporary hitpoints, or gives a bonus or advantage, the effect is doubled.

# Witching Paths

## Familiar Bond
Your field of witching specializes on enhancing your familiar into a powerful beast of battle, and an obedient creature of aid. Demonic sources of Magica are often expressed in this witching path, as the hordes of the void express in your familiars.

### Familiar attacker (level 3)
Your Familiar gains the ability to make an attack as an action on its turn. Whenever your familiar takes the attack action it uses your spellcasting modifier to make the attack roll, and deals 1d10 + your casting modifier necrotic or force (your choice when you get this feature) damage on a hit. Your familiar's health is also doubled, meaning its health is the same as yours.

### Void Tactics (level 3)
You have advantage on attack rolls against creatures within 5 feet of your familiar. 

### Horde (level 6)
Whenever you summon your familiar you may expend 5 hit dice and split it into 4 familiars who only have 1/4th of your maximum hitpoints each, and are incapable of casting cantrips, but retain the ability to take the attack action. 

## Trinket Maker
You start your journey on the path to a master arcane crafter, allowing others to use your talismans more freely. Infernal sources of Magica are often expressed in this witching path, as the flames of hell fuel your undying magical items.

### Storing Talismans (level 3)
Whenever you create a talisman you store magic unusable by you within it. Whenever a creature other than you attempts to cast a spell stored in a talisman for the first time after its creation, it does not cost them any hit dice.

### Thirsty Charms (level 3)
Whenever you do not have enough magica to cast a spell through your talisman you may offer your blood it it, taking damage equal to twice the magica cost and casting the spell. 

### Magical Duplication (level 6)
Whenever you find a magical item of rare rarity or below you may replicate it, filling 4 of your available talisman slots but performing identically to the true magic item until you disassemble the copy during a rest. You may only have two magical items copied in this way at a time.

## Hexer
You specialize in casting curses upon others, dwindling the enemy down until they snap as a twig, or breaking their mind to find their secrets. Faerie sources of Magica are often expressed in this witching path, as the cruel hexes of fae are granted to you.

### Heightened Curse (level 3)
Whenever you cast a spell that causes a negative effect against another creature the effect's duration is doubled. 

### Retribution (level 3)
Whenever another creature harms you you may expend 3 hit dice as a reaction forcing them to make a wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be cursed. If a creature is cursed in this way you may choose for them to have one of the following effects:

- The creature is unable to make attacks against you for 1d4 rounds
- The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws for 1d4 rounds
- The creature is inflicted with blindness until the end of your next turn
- The creature cannot regain hitpoints for 1d4 turns

### Great Hex (level 6)
As an action you may expend 5 hit dice and force a creature you can see to make a saving throw against your spell save DC or be hexed. This effect lasts for 8 hours. The nature of the hex and saving throw is decided from the following:

- **Strength:** The creature is cursed with weakness. The damage of their strength based attacks are halved and may not deal more than 10 damage in a single attack.
- **Dexterity:** The creature is cursed with clumsiness and sluggishness. Their AC is reduced by 5 and their movement speed is reduced to 10.
- **Constitution:** The creature is cursed with feebleness. Their hitpoint maximum is halved and they automatically fail checks against being poisoned, and automatically take maximum damage from poison.
- **Intelligence:** The creature's mind is shriveled as they are cursed with stupidity. Their intelligence score is reduced to 3 and they become as intelligent as a common beast
- **Wisdom:** The creatures senses are impeded. They become blind and deaf for the duration.
- **Charisma:** The creature is cursed with dullness. They have disadvantage on saves against being charmed and cannot discern when enchantment magic is used on them, even on a successful save.
