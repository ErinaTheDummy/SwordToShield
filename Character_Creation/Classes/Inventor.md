### Invent
You are capable of crafting items known as inventions over the course of a rest using scrap and a set of tools you are proficient with. Inventions are useful tools, weapons, and gear that help you in battle or over an adventure. Inventions are delicate and often times potent items, so you are only capable of upkeeping a number of inventions equal to your intelligence modifier plus half your inventor level at one time. Additionally you only take half as long and half as many resources to craft items during a downtime. You have proficiency in your inventions. You may find a list of all the inventions available to you at the end of this document. 

### Scrap
You are capable of scrapping 2 lbs of metal material, turning it into a usable unit of scrap.

### Augment
During a rest you are capable of applying augmentations to your Inventions, during their creation or as an addition to an already made invention. Augmentations change how an invention functions, subtly and drastically depending on context. Certain augmentations are required to utilize an invention, in such cases those augmentations should be listed in the requirements for the item. Augmentations come in three forms: Modifiers; which simply change the statistics of an item, Power sources; which change the requirements to use an item and how often an item can be used before needing to be "refueled" if applicable as well as the fuel source, and  Special; which add a new or interesting twist but require special components rather than standard scrap. You may apply a number of augmentations to an invention equal to your intelligence modifier, if this is not high enough to apply all the required augmentations for an invention you may apply the required augmentations anyway but are unable to apply any further augmentations. 

### Hitpoint Increase
Your hitpoints increase by 1d4 + your constitution modifier. If your constitution modifier increases by any means, reflect that change retroactively in your maximum hp.

### Inventive Legacy
Decide how to define your career as an inventor. Your inventive Legacy gives you access to new inventions and augmentations, as well as new modes of expression for both. You may choose one legacy from the following:

- Auto-augmenter: Augment yourself, overcome the inherent weaknesses of your flesh
- Artificer: Mix magic into the brew of creation, play both sides and reap the benefits

If none of these options seem appealing, you may instead take a passive buff, doubling the amount of inventions you can maintain at one time.

### Minor Hitpoint Increase
At 4th level, and every level after, add your constitution modifier to your maximum hitpoints. If your constitution modifier increases by any means, reflect that change retroactively in your maximum hp.

### Ability Score Increase
You may increase one of your ability scores by 2 or two of them by 1. You may forgo your ability score increase and take a feat instead.
