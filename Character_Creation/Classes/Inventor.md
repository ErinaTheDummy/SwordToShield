### Invent
You are capable of crafting items known as inventions over the course of a rest using scrap and a set of tools you are proficient with. Inventions are useful tools, weapons, and gear that help you in battle or over an adventure. Inventions are delicate and often times potent items, so you are only capable of upkeeping a number of inventions equal to your intelligence modifier plus your inventor level at one time. Additionally you only take half as long and half as many resources to craft items during a downtime. You have proficiency in your inventions. You may find a list of all the inventions available to you at the end of this document. 

#### Upkeeping inventions addendum
While you are only able to upkeep a certain number of inventions, the number of inventions you can create is only limited by the resources at your disposal. If you have an invention on standby which is not being upkept and another item is used to the point of interoperability which is not due to running out of charges, such as a single use item like the stim injector, you may spend a minute to get the invention that has not been upkept back into working order. 

### Scrap
You are capable of scrapping 2 lbs of metal material, turning it into a usable unit of scrap.

### Modify
During a rest you are capable of applying modifications to your Inventions, during their creation or as an addition to an already made invention. modifications change how an invention functions, subtly and drastically depending on context. Certain modifications are required to utilize an invention, in such cases those modifications should be listed in the requirements for the item. modifications come in two forms: Modifiers; which simply change the statistics of an item and Power sources; which change the requirements to use an item and how often an item can be used before needing to be "refueled" if applicable as well as the fuel source. You may apply as many non-contradictory modifier modifications to a single invention as you'd like, only one power source modification may be applied to an invention at one time. Modifications must be applied over a rest using smith's tools.

### Hitpoint Increase
Your hitpoints increase by 1d4 + your constitution modifier. If your constitution modifier increases by any means, reflect that change retroactively in your maximum hp.

### Inventive Legacy
You may choose to gain the benefits of the artificer subclass or simply double the amount of inventions you can maintain at one time.

### Minor Hitpoint Increase
At 4th level, and every level after, add your constitution modifier to your maximum hitpoints. If your constitution modifier increases by any means, reflect that change retroactively in your maximum hp.

### Ability Score Increase
You may increase one of your ability scores by 2 or two of them by 1. You may forgo your ability score increase and take a feat instead.

## Artificer

### Magical Tinkering (3rd level)
You gain the ability to mix magical items into your inventing escapades. You may modify magical items as if they were inventions created by you. This means you may apply any modifications that require analogous features or item bases. Magical items modified by you do not count against your maximum inventions. If a magic item says that it regains all charges at a certain point or a charge after a certain amount of time, but you apply a new power source to it, then it no longer regains power in that way and must be refueled as if it were an invention with that specific power source. 

### Vile Homonculus (6th level)
You learn occult knowledge that allows you to create a being based off of your own basic spiritual esoteric information. This being is a Homonculus, and may be a like-minded individual with a mind of it's own, or a vessel for some spirit or other ethereal being of your choosing. Homonculi are created with one sample of your flesh, 20 liters of alchohol, a pound of gold (20 GP) mixed together in a creation vat made from 200 scrap worth of materials. The creation vat may be re-used, but if your homonculus dies you must re-acquire the other ingredients to make another one. You may have up to 3 homonculi active at one time, they perform any menial task that you instruct them to, and show an undying loyalty to you. Each of your homonculi has the following statistics:

```
Homonculus
Tiny Monstrosity (Abomination)
HP: 7 (3d4)
AC: 10
Speed: 30ft, 30ft other speed of your choice
|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA|
| 08| 10| 12| **| 10| 03|
| -1| +0| +1| **| +0| -4|

** your homonculus has the same intelligence score as you
```

You may instruct your homonculi to upkeep inventions or aid in their creation, with 2 or more homonculi aiding you, you may complete a new invention that is not a structure within 10 minutes rather than over the course of a rest. For each homonculus you have, your maximum invention upkeep is increased by 2. Homonculi are also capable of taking the help and dodge action. Homonculi know all languages that you do and are capable of conversing in those languages. 

### Magic Item Replication (9th level)
Through extensive studies of the occult and esoteric, you have gained the ability to replicate magical items. Magic items created in this way count against your maximum upkeep of inventions. In order to replicate a magical item you must have at least one original version of the magical item, and spend 1 hour studying it. The scrap cost to replicate a magical item is based on its rarity, and usually requires at least some magical scrap. Refer to the following chart for the creation cost of each rarity of magic item, you may not recreate artifacts in this way.

```

|  Rarity       |  Cost                            |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- |

### Artificer modifications
Due to your mystical mixture of magic and the mundane you gain the following special modifications:

```
Copilot
Crafting Cost: 50 scrap, Moontear crystal (Thinking crystal)
Requirements: Must be applied to a vehicle, or armor set
Description:
This modific gives the invention a mind and will of its own while activated, allowing you to give it complex commands that it will obey if it so chooses. If you are operating the invention it cannot take control from you, but it may operate autonomously if you are not controlling it (such as not wearing the armor, or not driving the vehicle). If the copilot is cooperating with you it grants you a +5 to perception checks, pointing out things you may have missed
```

```
Aether net
Crafting cost: 100 scrap, aether spider silk
Requirements: Must be applied to an invention that consumes charges over time
Description:
This modific catches the natural aether energy flowing through the ambient environment and converts it to a small amount of usable energy, causing inventions that consume charges to consume a charge over a much longer period of operation. Multiplies the time between charge consumptions by 4.
```

```
Magical Infusion
Crafting cost: 300 scrap, blue manastone
Requirements: N/A
Description:
Turns one item into a "magical item" with a +1 attribute, allowing previously mundane weapons to overcome resistance to non-magical attacks.
```

```
Mana Compactor
Crafting Cost: 50 scrap, 5 lbs radotonium
Charges: 5
Rechargeable?: Yes
Description:
This power cell uses the latent mana that floats around everywhere to recharge its power supply! Regains all charges every day at dawn. If you run out of charges on an invention with this power source, you may use it once again, but the battery will crumble to dust
