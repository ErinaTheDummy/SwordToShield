# Body Types
this document details all of the different types of bodies and their features available to players to choose from in character creation

### Introduction to Body Type
A body type is an expression of the size and natural abilities of your character. Body types lack a name for each and instead can be described by a name of your own creation, or a list of all the features of a given body type.

### Ability Score Increase
An ability score increase is an increase to your rolled (or bought) stats determined by your unique physicality. ASIs are added after you roll your stats, meaning you may choose to allocate them where it would be most helpful to you. 

### Important Note
For the melee damage section of each body size there is a referenced "d1" you do not have to roll a one sided die for this and may simply use 1. The damage is only referred to in this way so that rulings that increase melee damage are
easier to word.
