Every great adventurer needs a hideout, a place to call home. Enclosed within 
this document are rules and guidelines for base building, settlements, and all 
sorts of fortification. 

# Outline
The following rules are introductions to the system at play for settlements and 
camps.

## Bases and Camps
When building a base its important to understand the distinction between a 
temporary camp and a permanent base. Permanent bases are built on foundations 
and are meant to survive after the party, temporary camps are meant to be 
portable places for rest between settlements. Camps merely require items such as
bedrolls and tents, but settlements require lots of gold and time to create

### Base Land Claims
In order to build a permanent base, you must first have the land to build it on. 
You must have at least one acre of mostly flat and uniform space to build with, 
in order to found a base.

## Land Utilization
depending on the size of your land claim, you will have a certain amount of 
development units (Du). Certain structures within your base will require a 
certain amount of space, expressed as Du. Whenever Du is utilized by a structure
it does not replenish until that structure is demolished or more land is
claimed.

### Settlement Development Units
a Du is 1000 square feet meaning that, every acre claimed for your settlement 
grants 49 Du.

# Buildings
Buildings are permanent structures within a base that provide some kind of bonus
over a rest or give some kind of 

## Settlement Buildings
The following buildings may be made within a base. This list displays the name 
of the buildings, the context under which they may be built, the Du, Time, & 
Gold cost of constructing them and the benefits they provide while in the 
settlement.  

```

Home

Du: 1
Time: 1 Week
Cost: 150 GP
Description:
A portion of the cost is used to hire a doctor who lives in your base. Your base
doctor provides the basic medical aid amenity while resting in the base. Rolls 
for hitpoint increases may also be treated as 1 higher than what you rolled, up

automatically roll the highest possible roll on hit dice expended to regain 
health over a rest within the base, provided you do nothing else over your rest.  
This high quality medical care also means that whenever you gain a hitpoint 
increase or reroll, you automatically roll the highest possible roll.
