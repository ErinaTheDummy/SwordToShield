# Introduction

## What is Sword to Shield?
Well, someone didn't read the readme! Sword to shield is a TTRPG (Short for tabletop role playing game) which is a sort of role playing game that runs in a collective conscience rather than as a computer program on thinking rocks. This particular system is based on 2 sided, 4 sided, 6 sided, 8 sided, 10 sided, 12 sided, 20 sided, and 100 sided dice (Hereafter referred to as "1d2" or "a coin" "1d4" "1d6" "1d8" "1d10" "1d12" "1d20" and "1d100" respectively). 

## System Intent
This system is intended to be used for high difficulty and deadly adventures, Player Characters are intended to start weak and become strong through a hero's journey. At no point during a game in this system should a character feel like an unkillable demigod who can press a button and "win" every time.

---

## Necessary Disclaimers

### X-Cards
In every TTRPG there are hardcore topics that may be encountered, ranging from bloody death to kidnapping to cults. It is important that everyone at the table playing a game be comfortable with ALL the content included. To players: if you feel uncomfortable at any point communicate "x-card" to your GM in some way along with a description of what is making you uncomfortable and the GM will handle it as quickly as possible. To GMs: if a player calls x-card, hear them out and quickly move away form the triggering subject matter. Many people come from all different walks of life under the TTRPG umbrella and it is important that ALL of them feel comfortable while playing in order to ENJOY that time. 

### Good Manners for Players
Now, not every uncomfortable situation will be the result of a GM. As a player you should always strive to be inclusive and careful of the feelings of other players. "Its what my character would do" is never a valid excuse to kill orphans and burn villages for no reason. Do not Hog all the fun, do not make a case against a ruling at the table, and do not complain when not everything goes your way.

### D1s
A one sided die, or D1, is certainly a kind of die that exists, but it does not serve any function when referred to in this system other than instantly rolling a 1 in cases when a 1 would not suffice; due to needing an easy way to augment the size of a die without referring to the amount of dice. An example, and probably the only use case for this is unarmed damage of different body types.

### Rules Disclaimer
As you read through these core rules you will find many rules which start with "VARIANT RULE:" these rules are included as explicit options but should not be assumed to be in use in every game. As a GM you may also find that there are missing rules or options not available, use your best judgment to fill in the-.

# Characters

## Abilities
In S2S there are six abilities, all with differing uses.

### Strength (Str)
Strength is your measure of raw power, determining how hard you hit and how much you can carry, push, and lift.

### Dexterity (Dex)
Dexterity is your measure of agility, It affects your combat readiness & your ability to handle finer motor functions. 

### Constitution (Con)
Constitution is your measure of physical health and well being, It determines your HP and will and your ability to resist disease

### Intelligence (Int)
Intelligence is the measure of things you have learned and your memory, Int checks are commonly made to reason and remember things. 

### Wisdom (Wis)
Wisdom is the the measure of your perception and intuition, It determines your passive perception and affects your will

### Charisma (Cha)
Charisma is the measure of your social influence, it determines your success in diplomacy and public speaking.

## Ability Scores and Modifiers
Ability scores are numbers ranging from 1-32 associated with your abilities that determine their modifier. Ability modifiers are the numbers associated with your abilities which are directly added to your rolls, Use the following chart for quick reference:

|  ---------------  |  --------------------------------------------  |
```

### Special Skills
Special skills function almost identically to other skills, but differ in the context they are used and the fact that they can only be gained through boons, feats, or class features.

### Making a Skill Check
In order to utilize your skill proficiencies you'll need to roll. Roll a 1d20 and add the modifier of one applicable attribute to the skill you're making a check with along with your proficiency bonus if you have proficiency in the skill. Your success or failure in this kind of check is decided by the GM, and you may have varying degrees of success depending on how high you roll. 

### Luck Points
Certain features give you something called "luck points". These points can be utilized before making a skill check, attack roll or saving throw, instantly producing a roll of 3 or 18 (player's choice). A player may use a luck point on their roll or the roll of another character they can see.

#### OPTIONAL: Inspiration
Your Gamemaster may provide you "inspiration" before, during, or after a session as they see fit. Inspiration is a token that you may use at any time to gain advantage on ANY roll. You may have a maximum of 3 tokens of inspiration at one time.

## Advantages and disadvantages
Certain things may grant "advantage" or "disadvantage". A roll made at advantage is rolled twice, with the larger roll being the outcome. A roll made at disadvantage is rolled twice, with the smaller roll being the outcome.

## Critical Failure and Success
When you make a roll to determine the outcome of an attempted action a natural roll of 20 always succeeds or hits and a natural roll of 1 always fails or misses. Your GM may choose for natural failures and successes to have additional effects. 

## Player Characters
As a real human, you are incapable of jumping through time and space to enter a fictional narrative, so you will exert your will in game through a player character! Your player character will receive features, ability scores, and equipment of your choice. In order to create a character you will need to do a wide range of things.

### Rolling Ability Scores
Roll 4d6, dropping the lowest roll and adding them together. Repeat this 6 times, recording the total each time. You may designate each of these totals to one ability, with the total becoming that ability's score. Calculate the modifier for each and record it on your sheet. 

#### VARIANT RULE: Stone Set Scores
Rather than designating your scores to your abilities as you see fit and wish, you may instead designate them to each stat in the order they were rolled. This rule is intended to help you "find" a character rather than make a planned one outright.

### Choosing a Background
Next, choose a background from the Backgrounds.md document in Character_Creation backgrounds are the most basic unit of lore for your character, simply describing their occupation and social standing before they experienced the call to adventuring and giving them a some features that match.

### OPTIONAL: Choosing a Culture
You may also, choose one culture from the Backgrounds.md document in Character_Creation. Apply the languages you gain from this culture. Culture describes the atmosphere and values of the place your character originated from, often times culture has large roleplay implications.

### Choosing a Creature type, Bodytype & Innate features
Next, choose a creature type, bodytype, and innate features from the BodyTypes.md document in Character_Creation. Body types change your size and give you certain attributes related to your physicality as well as giving you a modifier to your stats. be sure to read everything through, and ask your GM when you have questions.

#### VARIANT RULE: Choosing Skills
Rather than ending at choosing a bodytype you may choose 2 skills to have proficiency in. Proficiency is an additional modifier that you may add to your d20 skill check or any other check you are proficient in. Your proficiency bonus as a commoner is 1.

#### VARIANT RULE: Choosing Class at Start
Rather than ending at choosing a bodytype you may choose a class from the Character_Creation folder and begin at a level permitted by your GMs in that class.

#### OPTIONAL: Character Depth
Before your first session playing as a character, you may note and mention any flaws, morals, aspirations, social bonds, or other noteworthy aspects of your character to your GM. They should be certain to integrate that into their game, unless they state otherwise.

## Classes
Your class is your specialization as a character, giving you special abilities which allow you to brave battle and roleplay. If your GM is not using the variant rule "Choosing Class at Start" then you will be starting without a class.


## Non-Player Characters
Non-player characters (NPCs) are characters created and played by the GM that the player characters (PCs) are capable of interacting with. An evil monster is an NPC just the same as a friendly villager is an NPC.

---

# Combat
In most tales of adventure there will eventually be more... hostile encounters, these combat rules are meant to help organize those encounters.


## Initiative Count
When combat begins every combatant will roll 1d20, adding their dexterity modifier to the roll, this will henceforth be referred to as the respective combatant's "initiative". Initiative determines how soon you take your turn after combat begins with higher being sooner. If two combatants roll the same initiative the combatant with the higher dexterity score will go first. If this does not resolve the issue then both combatants will roll 1d20 and the combatant with the higher roll will go first.

## Armor Class
Armor class is your ability to resist attacks, to determine armor class refer to the armor you have equipped. If you have no armor equipped your AC is equal to 10 + Your Dexterity Modifier, some features and traits may alter your base AC.

## Capabilities on Your Turn
You are capable of performing the following on your turn:

- 1 action (attacking, dodging, etc.)
- 1 bonus action (Special Actions, Consuming Tinctures or Potions)
- Moving (a distance up to your movement speed)
- 1 free object interaction (picking up an item, pulling a lever, etc.)

### Actions on Your Turn
on your turn you are capable of taking many different actions, some of the most common ones are listed here:

- Attack: Make one melee or attack against another creature. 
- Cast A Spell: You may cast a spell which you know and has a casting time of one action.
- Grapple: You make a grapple contest against one creature
- Dodge: You spend your action readying against incoming attacks. You gain advantage on dexterity checks and all attacks made from an enemy that you see have disadvantage.
- Disengage: You disengage making it so that creatures cannot make an attack of opportunity against you for walking outside of their melee range.
- Dash: You dash, doubling your movement speed for this turn.
- Help: You may help another creature, giving them advantage on their next roll, additionally you may use this action to distract an enemy giving the next attack against them advantage.
- Hide: Provided you are out of sight you may hide behind cover
- Ready: You prepare an action with a specific trigger, using your reaction to act when the conditions are met.
- Aid: You may attempt to medically aid one creature within 5 feet of you, roll a medicine check, on a 16 or higher their health becomes 0 and they are stabilized

### Free actions on your turn
on your turn there are certain things you may do without expending anything! You may not repeat a free action until your next turn.

- Listen: You attempt to locate a creature you cannot see within 240 feet of you. Make a perception check against the creature's stealth roll, on a success you are able to perceive their location but still cannot see them, you may treat this as "seeing" the creature for the purpose of attack rolls and spell targeting.
- Drop: You drop an item you are holding in your hand, or release someone from your grasp
- Equip: You equip an item from your inventory
- Speak: You say a sentence or a few words
- Gesture: You gesture to another creature
- End Concentration: You end concentration on a spell, ending its effects
- Jump: You jump a number of feet equal to your str score or dex score, you consume movement speed while moving across this distance, but are always able to jump up to your max range as long as you have 1 foot of movement speed left on your turn

#### Making an attack
When you make an attack, roll 1d20 and add the associated modifiers to the roll. The goal of this roll is to roll above the AC of your target. If your roll beats the AC of your target the attack hits.

##### Attack Damage
When an attack hits roll damage for that attack, roll the size and number of dice specified by the weapon or ability and add the applicable ability modifier unless the weapon or ability states otherwise.

##### Dual Wielding
You may wield a one handed light weapon in your off hand and make attacks with it as a bonus action. You may not add your applicable modifier to the damage of the bonus action attack.

##### Unarmed Strikes
When attacking without a weapon you deal an amount of damage equal to your damage die count for your size, plus your strength modifier. If you have an innate feature that augments your unarmed strike die size, "1d8 Natural Weapon" for example, you calculate the damage for your unarmed strikes by changing the damage die of your attacks from a d1 to the damage die specified (1d8 in this example). All creatures are proficient in unarmed strikes.

##### Called shots
Sometimes in combat you may find it more advantageous to focus fire on a specific part of an enemy, but these kind of attacks may be harder to land! refer to the following chart for the effects and attack roll penalties.

```
|                Target                 | Attack Penalty |                         Effect                         |
|---------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Extremely small weakspot (eyes)       |            -10 | damage is doubled, target is blinded if targeting eyes |
| Small weakspot (head)                 |             -7 | damage is doubled                                      |
| Large weakspot (break in armor)       |             -5 | damage is multiplied by 1.5                            |
| Nonlethal weakspot (weapon of target) |             -4 | Target is disarmed, takes no damage                    |
| Small extremities (hands)             |             -3 | target drops held item, disadvantage on next attack    |
| Large extremities (legs)              |             -2 | target's movement speed halved                         |
```

This chart defines some target locations that certainly exist on most beasts and humanoids, but certain creatures may not have these structures on their morphology, it is up to the discretion on the GM to decide what the analagous structures for these weakpoints would be on a monster to monster basis as well as perhaps requiring a check to discern a weakspot as a free action. 

#### Casting a Spell
When casting a spell as an action, refer to the spell's listing in the spell compendium and follow the instructions listed. If a spell refers to a spell attack, whether ranged or melee, the modifier for this attack is your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. Spell will reference many parameters as shorthand, the full explanations are as follows:

##### Spell Range
For a spell to target a creature or object it must be within the spell's range spell range is expressed as a flat distance or touch. When you cast a touch spell you may also target yourself, although sometimes this may not be a good idea.

##### Components
Nearly all spells require either Verbal (the ability to speak) or Somatic (the ability to move your body) components but some higher level spells may require expensive Material components. You cannot cast a spell without the relevant components. 

###### Spell Focuses
Spell components with no listed GP cost are able to be supplemented by simply using a spell focus! If you have a spell focus equipped and cast a spell that has components with no GP cost then ignore the material components of the spell.

##### Duration 
Duration refers to the length of time the spell takes place over. Instantaneous spells have no duration as they happen in a single instant, but concentration spells take effect for a specific amount of time or until you choose to end them(in some cases). Certain spells will have a duration but not require concentration

###### Breaking Concentration
You may break concentration to end a concentration spell at any time as a free action. Concentration also ends if you fall unconscious or are incapacitated or killed. If you take damage while concentrating on a spell make a will roll to maintain concentration with the DC being 8 + the damage sustained or half the damage sustained, whichever is higher, On a failure your concentration ends.

##### Targets
Targets describe who you may make the spell take effect on, often specifying a creature, object, or area of effect.

#### Area of effect
Certain spells will exert an effect over a wide area, the description of these areas is as follows: 

##### Cone
A cone extends in a direction you choose from wherever the spell specifies its point of origin. At any point throughout a cone it's width is equal to distance from the point of origin. A cone's area of effect is determined by its distance.

##### Cube
You select a cube's point of origin, which is anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube's area of effect is the length of each side.

##### Cylinder

A cylinder's point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect.

##### Line
A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.

##### Sphere
You select a sphere's point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere's size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.

#### Mana and Will Rolls in Spellcasting.
You may sometimes encounter life or death situations where you need to push your spellcasting abilities to the limits, this is what the will and mana skills are for. 

##### Mana 
When you cast a spell you may push your ability to the limit, roll a Mana skill check and the GM will use their discretion to apply special effects to the spell. You must ask your GM before attempting to perform this

##### Will
When you are out of spellcasting ability (ex: grace for a priest) you are unable to cast spells, unless your GM allows you to will them into working temporarily. Make a will skill check, on a 16 or higher you may cast a first or second level spell taking one or two points of damage respectively.

#### Grapple
You make an athletics check against one creature within 5 feet of you which the target may contest with either athletics or acrobatics, the target may be no more than one size larger than you. On a failure they are grappled. You have disadvantage on grappling creatures larger than you.

#### Hide
You attempt to hide, making a stealth check against the passive perception of every combatant who saw you in your previous location, on a success you are hidden behind full cover.

## Hitpoints
Hitpoints are a measure of your physical wellbeing and consciousness. When your hitpoints drop to 0 or lower you fall unconscious. If you have 0 or fewer hitpoints on your turn you must expend a hit dice and roll a d20, an 11 or higher is considered a success. On 3 Cumulative successes you survive, On 3 cumulative failures you die. if you are at 0 hitpoints and have no hit dice on the start of your turn you die. If you sustain damage greater than 2 times your maximum hitpoints you die instantly.

### VARIANT RULE: Conscious At No Health
Rather than passing out immediately at 0 or fewer hitpoints you may make a health roll against half the damage you sustained or 8 + the damage sustained (whichever is higher) on a success you remain standing. Repeat this roll at the start of each of your turns, you fall unconscious and begin dying on a failure.

### Damage
When you sustain damage remove the amount of damage you took from your current hitpoints

### Temporary Hitpoints
Temporary hitpoints disappear after an hour unless specified otherwise and are granted by a multitude of features and spells, if you take damage and have temporary hitpoints, subtract the damage from your temporary hitpoints with the remaining damage effecting your regular hitpoints.

### Damage Resistance
Certain features and armors may grant a damage resistance score or a damage type resistance, these two things are very different from each other. Below you may find the distinctions between the two.

#### Damage Reduction Score (DR)
Your damage reduction score is simply a defense against physical damage such as bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. When you sustain an amount of physical damage LESS than your DR You may ignore it, treating it as if you are immune to the damage type for that attack. When you sustain an amount of physical damage GREATER than your DR however, you subtract your DR from the damage dealt to you and then take the remaining damage as normal.

#### Damage Type Resistance
Damage type resistance is simply an ability to resist a certain type of damage. When you sustain a type of damage you are resistant to, you take half the damage rolled rather than all of it. An example would be the resistance of a warrior in frenzy.

## Battle injuries 

### Staggered
Certain weapons and attacks may stagger, when targeted by an attack that staggers the target must make a health roll against the damage sustained or 10 + half the damage sustained, whichever is higher. On a failed save, they have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and can't take reactions, until the end of their next turn.

### Thrusting
When you are hit by an attack that deals piercing damage the weapon thrusts deep into any soft tissue it may contact, causing massive organ damage. When not wearing heavy armor a natural roll of 20 on a weapon that deals piercing damage deals double damage.

### Bleeding Wound
When you are hit by an attack that deals slashing damage you may sustain extensive damage to surface level soft tissues, leaving a grievous wound if untreated. When hit by a slashing weapon and dealt maximum damage you begin
to bleed, taking 1d4 damage at the start of each of your turns until you or another creature expend an action to stop the bleeding using a bandage or medical kit. You may also stop the bleeding with a healing spell that rolls a 10 or higher for hitpoints regained or a spell such as lesser restoration. This damage due to bleeding cannot be reduced in any way. 

### Fractures and Breaks
When you take an amount of bludgeoning damage in a turn that is greater than or equal to half your hitpoints roll a d4. On a 1 your sustain a Break or Fracture. Refer to the chart to see the severity of the injury based on the amount of damage sustained (note that each level of severity stacks with the previous ones)

```
|  Damage Sustained  |  Severity Level and Effects.                    |  Recovery        |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
|  50%  - 70%        |  1. Fractured limb, -5 feet move speed.         |  5 days          |
|  71%  - 90%        |  2. Severe Fracture, -10 feet move speed.       |  12 days         |
|  91%  - 99%        |  3. Broken Limb, Move speed no greater than 5.  |  20 days         |
|  100% +            |  4. Compound Fracture, Disadvantage on all saves|  35 days         |
|                    |     move speed may be no greater than 0.        |                  |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
```
After an amount of time equal to the difference in recovery time between each level of severity your wound moves down one level. Meaning that after 15 days a compound fracture would simply be a broken limb and after 8 more days the broken limb would simply be a sever fracture and so on. Rather than wait the recovery time you may quickly heal a fracture or break by regaining an amount of hitpoints, equal to the recovery time in days, over the course of 1 minute. A lesser restoration or similar spell would also heal the wound instantly. 

### Battle Injury Disclaimer
These injuries apply to all creatures except for Undead, Leviathans, Plants, Fungi, and Constructs. They are worded in the second person to make them more easily understandable for players but the effects can be applied to most creatures.

# Adventuring
Adventuring is the core of the game! seeing places, meeting interesting people and killing them! Here are the guidelines for adventuring:

## Resting and Sustained living
As a mortal being you will require rest and certain amenities during that rest, for each amenity you satisfy you will regain a hit die during a rest. You may also expend hit dice during a rest to regain hitpoints. A rest spans over 8 hours during which you sleep for at least 6 hours and engage in light activity for the remaining time.

### Amenities
Different characters of different creature types require different amenities during a rest, the most common creature type for a character being humanoid. The amenities for a humanoids are as follows:

- Pound of food
- Liter of drink
- Bed
- Fire
- Shelter
- Extra pound of food
- Extra liter of drink
- Comfortable bed
- Medical aid
- High quality medical aid

#### Meditation
Whenever you decide to rest you may choose to meditate instead. Meditation is a supplement for resting where you do not sleep or perform light activity, but instead clear your mind and relax your body. Meditating does not allow you to perform actions that specify they must be performed during a rest nor does it satisfy your body's need for sleep but it does grant you 2 hit dice without using any amenities, and have certain effects on sanity. otherwise it is identical to a rest.  

## Going Without
For every day you go without either food, drink, or sleep you lose access to 2 of your maximum hit dice, dying when the maximum reaches 0.

## Special Cases
Certain features will free you from needing food, drink, and sleep. In these cases simply count those amenities as automatically fulfilled, unless stated otherwise.

## Sight
Generally speaking, most battlefields in a setting will most likely have a light-source, but when delving into dungeons you may enter a dark or even pitch black area. You need to be able to see to do many things, including casting most spells that target a single creature or attacking normally. Attacks made while in a situation where they are outside one of your site ranges are made at disadvantage in darkness or while an illusory effect is over an area, and at an additional -5 in pitch blackness. There are many ways to get around loss of sight due to certain effects!

### Dimvision
Dimvision allows a creature in simple darkness and dim lighting to act and see as if they were in normal light levels, and also allows them to ignore the additional -5 to attack rolls in pitch blackness.

### Darkvision
Darkvision allows a creature to see within nonmagical pitch blackness as if it is normal lighting out to a certain range, and also grants the benefits of dimvision.

### Devil's Sight
Devil's Sight is a warlock invocation that allows a creature to see within any pitch blackness as if it is normal lighting out to a certain range, and also grants the benefits of dimvision.

### Truesight
Truesight allows a creature to see invisible creatures, see through illusions such as illusory terrain or a disguise spell, and see within any pitch blackness as if it is normal lighting, all out to a certain range, while also granting the benefits of dimvision.

## Languages
Within the world there will most definitely be characters from differing cultures with different tongues, a creature cannot converse with another unless they are both capable of speaking and understanding the same language. The same goes for reading, a creature may not read text unless it is in a language they understand. The following table displays available languages as well as the type of rarity/context you might expect to see them in.

```
| Language Type |                          languages                          |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Common        | Ulfen, Ebrannan, Valari, Handspeak, Solari                  |
| Exotic        | Machine Language, Deonic, Chitterspeak, Primean, Anirandrus |
| Mystic        | Arcanium, Nixian, Voidspeak, Deepspeech                     |
| Ancient       | Varanus, Brogian, Celestial, Infernal, Abyssal              |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
```

### Common Languages
Common languages are regional or country-wide languages, if you speak one of these you'll probably be able to communicate freely with anyone in the region where they are considered common.

#### Ulfen
Common language of Ulfos, created due to societal isolation from the northern half of the world. Spoken most commonly by traders in the area north of Arourea, spoken by common people in Ulfos.

#### Ebrannan 
Ebranan is spoken in North and South Ebrana. In North Ebrana, speaking Ebranan is considered to be a sign of belonging to the lower class. 

#### Valari
Valari is spoken in the six tribes of eastern Valarus. There are six dialects, one for each tribe. When you learn Valari, pick which dialect you speak from the following: 
- Sudryal
- Khiiral
- Qimari
- Bimaer
- Caizer
- Talanashta
A speaker of one dialect can understand basic concepts of another, but must learn the other dialect in order to understand details. There is no written form of Valari.

#### Handspeak
Handspeak is a language which relies on visual cues made through hand-signs. A person who does not know hand speak but knows at least one other common language can discern the basic meaning of a person speaking in hand speak, but they cannot understand specific details unless they speak the same dialect of handspeak. There are four dialects of handspeak, when you learn handspeak choose one or take the dialect of your teacher.
- Ulfen
- Ebrannan
- Aniran
- Maldrite

#### Solari
Solari is the national language of Solaris, Solaris was formerly under oppressive dragon rule and there has been a cultural renaissance in the years since then, meaning that languages other than Solari are less likely to get a response in Solaris.

### Exotic languages
Exotic languages are languages which are less commonly spoken, usually used in a very specific context or requiring a specific special physiology to speak it.

#### Machine Language
Machine language is spoken by constructs to other constructs. Machine language may not be understood by non-construct creatures unless they have magic, tools, or implants to help them. If a specific passage or recording of machine language were studied by non-constructs they could crack its encryption and understand it by working over the course of a rest and passing an intelligence check. Machine language comes in three dialects, all speakers and readers of any dialect can understand, read, and write all other dialects, but they differ in difficulty of encryption.
```
|  Dialect   | Difficulty (Intelligence check) |
|------------|---------------------------------|
| Morse      |                              12 |
| Gittercode |                              18 |
| 13375p34k  |                              24 |
```

#### Deonic
Deonic is spoken in Deona. Only Deon possess the vocal anatomy to speak Deonic, but anyone can learn the written form.

#### Chitterspeak
Chitterspeak is similar to Deonic, originating from insectoids and other races with special anatomy in Ulfos, but due to its much less harsh pronunciations it can be spoken by any creature. The written form of Chitterspeak simply uses Ulfen writing formalities and can be read by anyone who knows Ulfen.

#### Primean
Primean is a language made of animalistic grunts, roars, trills, Purrs, hisses, barks, coos, chirps, ribbits, squeaks and growls. Primean is a natural language that formed over thousands of years through the interactions of beastfolks and it is ever growing and changing. Chances are, if you meet a beast folk, this is their first language.

#### Anirandrus
Anirandrus is a language spoken by those who are deep in the Anirite faith, usually those who only engage with others of the faith. It is a language made of social isolation descendant from celestial, speakers of celestial may extract basic words from passages and speech in Anirandrus and vice versa. 

### Mystic Languages
These are languages inherently tied to magic and the mystical, tread lightly when speaking in them as even reactive words can be a small magic in their own way.

#### Arcanium
Language of glyphs used by wizards to make spells. If you know Arcanium you can understand what spells a wizard has prepared or what an incantation inscribed into an ancient ruin might mean.

#### Nixian
Language spoken by citizens of wonderland, the home of the fae, also commonly spoken by high elves.

#### Voidspeak
Langauge of demons.

#### Deepspeech
Language of Abberations and all the creatures from the far edges of the universe. Spoken in guttural deep hums and tongue clicks.

### Ancient Languages
Languages that pre-date all recorded history.

#### Varanus
Language of Dragons.

#### Brogian
Language of Giants.

#### Celestial
Language of The Heavens.

#### Infernal
Language of The Hells.

#### Abyssal
Language of leviathans, beings older than the universe. 

## Corruption
While adventuring you may encounter many harmful environmental effects, the most notable and visceral of these effects is corruption. Corruptions arise from interactions with corruptants, and they cause potent and often detrimental effects on your body. A list of all corruption tables may be found in the [Accursed Journal.md](https://github.com/ErinaTheDummy/SwordToShield/blob/main/Gamemaster_Resources/AccursedJournal.md#corruptions) document

### Radiative Corruptants
A radiative corruptant corrupts over an area of effect, with the corruption chance and corruptive effects getting more and more dire as you get closer. The following chart outlines distance from different strength radiative corruptants and how that might affect an adventurer as well as constitution save DCs for resisting the corruptive effect.

#### Extreme Corruptant

```
+-----------+----+-------------------------------------------+
| Distance  | DC |                  Effect                   |
+-----------+----+-------------------------------------------+
| 5 feet    | 26 | Roll on BAD corruptions                   |
| 25 feet   | 22 | Roll on BAD or Minor Det. corruptions     |
| 625 feet  | 18 | Roll on Minor Det. Corruptions            |
| 3000 feet | 14 | Roll on Minor Det. or neutral corruptions |
+-----------+----+-------------------------------------------+
```

#### Strong Corruptant

```
+-----------+----+-------------------------------------------------+
| Distance  | DC |                     Effect                      |
+-----------+----+-------------------------------------------------+
| 5 feet    | 20 | Roll on BAD or Minor Det. corruptions           |
| 25 feet   | 18 | Roll on BAD, Minor Det., or Neutral corruptions |
| 625 feet  | 14 | Roll on Minor Det. or Neutral corruptions       |
| 3000 feet |  8 | Roll on Neutral Corruptions                     |
+-----------+----+-------------------------------------------------+
```

#### Weak Corruptant

```
+-----------+----+--------------------------------------------+
| Distance  | DC |                   Effect                   |
+-----------+----+--------------------------------------------+
| 5 feet    | 16 | Roll on Minor Det. corruptions             |
| 25 feet   | 14 | Roll Minor Det. or Neutral corruptions     |
| 625 feet  | 12 | Roll on neutral corruptions                |
| 3000 feet |  8 | Roll on neutral or Minor Bene. corruptions |
+-----------+----+--------------------------------------------+
```

### Contact Corruptants
Contact corruptants corrupts whatever they touch. The type of corruption decided by contact corruption is innate to the object but an example includes:

```
The Dark Scepter of Detrorphius the Mad
Rarity: Artifact
Attunement: Y
Description: 
This black metal staff adorned with a massive purple gem at the top once 
belonged to Detrorphius the Mad, an evil wizard long destroyed by the forces of 
good. As an action a creature attuned to this weapon may instantly kill one 
creature within 120 feet with a blast of dark energy. This object is cursed 
attuning to it grants you 2 bad corruptions and you must make a DC 18 wisdom 
saving throw or fall under one of the following effects:

+------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Roll (1d4) |                                     Effect                                     |
+------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1          | You begin to harbor an intense greed and hatred for generosity                 |
| 2-4        | Detrorphius possesses you at random, granting the GM control of your character |
+------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

* do not that this is not a real or balanced magic item, and it is not intended to be given to players, it is simply an example 
```


### Consumable Corruptants 
Consumable corruptants are the most unreliable of all corruptants. When consumed the consuming creature must make a flat DC check decided by the corruptant or roll randomly for both the corruption chart and the corruption inflicted. This causes consumable corruptants to either strengthen or significantly weaken characters who consume them.


## Sanity
Everyone has their mental limits, even honed and well seasoned adventurers. Encounters with the esoteric and unknown, and near death experiences can take a mental toll. 

### Sanity Limit
Your maximum sanity is equal to your wisdom score, this is your baseline level of perfect mental health, dropping below this level does not inherently spell doom, but can have adverse effects. While at your maximum sanity, no matter how low, you do not suffer from any effects of being mad or insane.  

#### Madness and Insanity
At certain sanity ranges you gain ill effects called madnesses, until you become completely insane. 

### Sanity Ranges 
The following chart details the amount of madnesses you have at a given sanity level. Remember that you cannot be affected by any of these unless you are below your maximum sanity.  


```

|  Sanity  |  Effects                                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
|  8       |  1 madness effects                         |
|  6       |  2 madness effects                         |
|  5       |  3 madness effects                         |
|  4       |  4 madness effects                         |
|  2       |  5 madness effects                         |
|  1       |  6 madness effects                         |
|  0       |  Insanity. (Keep madness effects)          |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ |

```

#### Madness Effects
Refer to the [accursed journal](https://github.com/ErinaTheDummy/SwordToShield/blob/main/Gamemaster_Resources/AccursedJournal.md#madness) for the chart to randomly roll on for the effects of madness. 

### Total Insanity
While Insane, you lose the ability to think logically, automatically failing any wisdom, intelligence, or charisma saves or checks. You also lose the ability to use any class features, and may only dash, attack, or hide on your turn. Going insane knocks you down to base survival instincts. 

#### Curing Madness & Insanity
Curing madness and insanity is simple, a madness effect/insanity is cured whenever you are at a sanity higher than the sanity level at which you acquire it. Meditation, lesser restoration, and restoration are capable of increasing your sanity. The lesser restoration spell or 8 hours of meditation will increase your sanity by 1 up to your maximum sanity level, and the restoration spell will instantly restore you to your maximum sanity.

#### Temporary Cures
You may not be capable of restoring your sanity completely through one long meditation session, but still wish to be capable in battle. Certain tinctures and temporary remedies may be capable of aiding you. Magical and nonmagical Apothecaries may hold what you seek.
