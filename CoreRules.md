# Introduction

## What is Sword to Shield?
Well, someone didn't read the readme! Sword to shield is a TTRPG 
(Short for tabletop role playing game) which is a sort of role playing game 
that runs in a collective conscience rather than as a computer program on 
thinking rocks. This particular system is based on 2 sided, 4 sided, 6 sided,
8 sided, 10 sided, 12 sided, 20 sided, and 100 sided dice (Hereafter refered
to as "1d2" or "a coin" "1d4" "1d6" "1d8" "1d10" "1d12" "1d20" and "1d100" 
respectively). 

## System Intent
This system is intended to be used for high difficulty and 
deadly adventures, Player Characters are intended to start weak and become 
strong through a hero's journey. At no point during a game in this system should
a character feel like an unkillable demigod who can press a button and "win" 
every time. If this is not what you envision for your game then I would 
reccomend a system currently (as of 2023) in it's fifth iteration, made by a 
certain group of wizards on the western seaboard of the united states.


## Necessary Disclaimers

### X-Cards
In every TTRPG there are hardcore topics that may be encountered, ranging from
bloody death to kidnapping to cults. It is imporant that everyone at the table
playing a game be comfortable with ALL the content included. To players: if you
feel uncomfortable at any point communicate "x-card" to your GM in some way
along with a description of what is making you uncomfortable and the GM will
handle it as quickly as possible. To GMs: if a player calls x-card, hear them
out and quickly move away form the triggering subject matter. Many people come
from all different walks of life under the TTRPG umbrella and it is important
that ALL of them feel comfortable while playing in order to ENJOY that time. 

### Good Manners for Players
Now, not every uncomfortable situation will be the result of a GM. As a player
you should always strive to be inclusive and careful of the feelings of other
players. "Its what my character would do" is never a valid excuse to kill
orphans and burn villages for no reason. Do not Hog all the fun, make a case 
against a ruling at the table, or complain when not everything goes your way.

### Rules Disclaimer
As you read through these core rules you will find many rules which start with
"VARIANT RULE:" these rules are included as explicit options but should not be
assumed to be in use in every game. As a GM you may also find that there are
missing rules or options not available, use your best judgement to fill in the-.


# Characters

## Abilities
In S2S there are six abilities, all with differing uses.

### Strength (Str)
Strength is your measure of raw power, determining how hard you hit and how
much you can carry, push, and lift.

### Dexterity (Dex)
Dexterity is your measure of agility, It affects your combat readiness & your
ability to handle finer motor functions. 

### Constitution (Con)
Constitution is your measure of physical health and well being, It determines
your HP and will and your ability to resist disease

### Intelligence (Int)
Intelligence is the measure of things you have learned and your memory, Int
checks are commonly made to reason and remember things. 

### Wisdom (Wis)
Wisdom is the the measure of your perception and intuition, It determines your
passive perception and affects your will

### Charisma (Cha)
Charisma is the measure of your social influence, it determines your success
in diplomacy and public speaking.

## Ability Scores and Modifiers
Ability scores are numbers ranging from 1-32 associated with your abilities that
determine their modifier. Ability modifiers are the numbers associated with your
abilities which are directly added to your rolls, Use the following chart for 
quick reference:

to interact with the world. Refer to the following chart for skills and their 
applicable attributes:

```

### Making a Skill Check
In order to utilize your skill proficiencies you'll need to roll. Roll a 1d20
and add the modifier of one applicable attribute to the skill you're making a
check with along with your proficiency bonus if you have proficiency in the 
skill. Your success or failure in this kind of check is decided by the DM, and
you may have varying degrees of success depending on how high you roll. 

## Player Characters
As a real human, you are incapable of jumping through time and space to enter a 
fictional narritive, so you will exhert your will in game through a player
character! Your player character will recive features, ability scores, and
equipment of your choice. In order to create a character you will need to do a 
wide range of things.

### Rolling Ability Scores
Roll 4d6, dropping the lowest roll and adding them together. Repeat this 6 times,
recording the total each time. You may designate each of these totals to one
ability, with the total becoming that ability's score. Calculate the modifier
for each and record it on your sheet. 

#### VARIANT RULE: Stone Set Scores
Rather than designating your scores to your abilities as you see fit and wish,
you may instead designate them to each stat in the order they were rolled. This
rule is intended to help you "find" a character rather than make a planned one 
outright.


### Choosing a Culture
Next, choose one culture from the Cultures.md document in Character_Creation.
Apply the languages and free feature you gain from this culture and two features
of your choice from your respective culture's features list. Culture describes
the atmosphere and values of the place your character originated from, often
times culture has large roleplay implications.

### Choosing a Background
Next, choose a background from the Backgrounds.md document in Character_Creation
backgrounds are the most basic unit of lore for your character, simply
describing their occupation before they experienced the call to adventuring.

### Choosing a Bodytype
Next, choose a bodytype from the BodyTypes.md document in Character_Creation.
Body types change your size and give you certain attributes related to your 
physicality as well as giving you a modifier to your stats.

#### VARIANT RULE: Choosing Skills
Rather than ending at choosing a bodytype you may choose 2 skills to have
proficiency in. Proficiency is an additional modifier that you may add to
your d20 skill check or any other check you are proficient in. Your proficiency 
bonus as a commoner is 1.

#### VARIANT RULE: Choosing Class at Start
Rather than ending at choosing a bodytype you may choose a class from the
Character_Creation folder and begin at a level permitted by your GMs in that 
class.


## Classes
Your class is your specialization as a character, giving you special abilities
which allow you to brave battle and roleplay. If your GM is not using the 
variant rule "Choosing Class at Start" then you will be starting without a class.


## Non-Player Characters
Non-player characters (NPCs) are characters created and played by the GM that
the player characters (PCs) are capable of interacting with. An evil monster is 
an NPC just the same as a friendly villager is an NPC.
