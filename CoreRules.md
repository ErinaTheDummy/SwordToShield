# Introduction

## What is Sword to Shield?
Well, someone didn't read the readme! Sword to shield is a TTRPG 
(Short for tabletop role playing game) which is a sort of role playing game 
that runs in a collective conscience rather than as a computer program on 
thinking rocks. This particular system is based on 2 sided, 4 sided, 6 sided,
8 sided, 10 sided, 12 sided, 20 sided, and 100 sided dice (Hereafter refered
to as "1d2" or "a coin" "1d4" "1d6" "1d8" "1d10" "1d12" "1d20" and "1d100" 
respectively). 

## System Intent
This system is intended to be used for high difficulty and 
deadly adventures, Player Characters are intended to start weak and become 
strong through a hero's journey. At no point during a game in this system should
a character feel like an unkillable demigod who can press a button and "win" 
every time. If this is not what you envision for your game then I would 
reccomend a system currently (as of 2023) in it's fifth iteration, made by a 
certain group of wizards on the western seaboard of the united states.


## Necessary Disclaimers

### X-Cards
In every TTRPG there are hardcore topics that may be encountered, ranging from
bloody death to kidnapping to cults. It is imporant that everyone at the table
playing a game be comfortable with ALL the content included. To players: if you
feel uncomfortable at any point communicate "x-card" to your GM in some way
along with a description of what is making you uncomfortable and the GM will
handle it as quickly as possible. To GMs: if a player calls x-card, hear them
out and quickly move away form the triggering subject matter. Many people come
from all different walks of life under the TTRPG umbrella and it is important
that ALL of them feel comfortable while playing in order to ENJOY that time. 

### Good Manners for Players
Now, not every uncomfortable situation will be the result of a GM. As a player
you should always strive to be inclusive and careful of the feelings of other
players. "Its what my character would do" is never a valid excuse to kill
orphans and burn villages for no reason. Do not Hog all the fun, make a case 
against a ruling at the table, or complain when not everything goes your way.

### Rules Disclaimer
As you read through these core rules you will find many rules which start with
"VARIANT RULE:" these rules are included as explicit options but should not be
assumed to be in use in every game. As a GM you may also find that there are
missing rules or options not available, use your best judgement to fill in the-.


# Characters

## Abilities
In S2S there are six abilities, all with differing uses.

### Strength (Str)
Strength is your measure of raw power, determining how hard you hit and how
much you can carry, push, and lift.

### Dexterity (Dex)
Dexterity is your measure of agility, It affects your combat readiness & your
ability to handle finer motor functions. 

### Constitution (Con)
Constitution is your measure of physical health and well being, It determines
your HP and will and your ability to resist disease

### Intelligence (Int)
Intelligence is the measure of things you have learned and your memory, Int
checks are commonly made to reason and remember things. 

### Wisdom (Wis)
Wisdom is the the measure of your perception and intuition, It determines your
passive perception and affects your will

### Charisma (Cha)
Charisma is the measure of your social influence, it determines your success
in diplomacy and public speaking.

## Ability Scores and Modifiers
Ability scores are numbers ranging from 1-32 associated with your abilities that
determine their modifier. Ability modifiers are the numbers associated with your
abilities which are directly added to your rolls, Use the following chart for 
quick reference:

to interact with the world. Refer to the following chart for skills and their

|  Diplomacy        |  Charisma, Intelligence                        |
|  ---------------  |  --------------------------------------------  |
```

### Special Skills
Special skills function almost identically to other skills, but differ in the
context they are used and the fact that they can only be gained through boons, 
feats, or class features.

### Making a Skill Check
In order to utilize your skill proficiencies you'll need to roll. Roll a 1d20
and add the modifier of one applicable attribute to the skill you're making a
check with along with your proficiency bonus if you have proficiency in the 
skill. Your success or failure in this kind of check is decided by the DM, and
you may have varying degrees of success depending on how high you roll. 

## Advantages and disadvantages
Certain things may grant "advantage" or "disadvantage". A roll made at advantage
is rolled twice, with the larger roll being the outcome. A roll made at 
disadvantage is rolled twice, with the smaller roll being the outcome.   

## Player Characters
As a real human, you are incapable of jumping through time and space to enter a 
fictional narritive, so you will exhert your will in game through a player
character! Your player character will recive features, ability scores, and
equipment of your choice. In order to create a character you will need to do a 
wide range of things.

### Rolling Ability Scores
Roll 4d6, dropping the lowest roll and adding them together. Repeat this 6 times,
recording the total each time. You may designate each of these totals to one
ability, with the total becoming that ability's score. Calculate the modifier
for each and record it on your sheet. 

#### VARIANT RULE: Stone Set Scores
Rather than designating your scores to your abilities as you see fit and wish,
you may instead designate them to each stat in the order they were rolled. This
rule is intended to help you "find" a character rather than make a planned one 
outright.


### Choosing a Culture
Next, choose one culture from the Cultures.md document in Character_Creation.
Apply the languages and free feature you gain from this culture and two features
of your choice from your respective culture's features list. Culture describes
the atmosphere and values of the place your character originated from, often
times culture has large roleplay implications.

### Choosing a Background
Next, choose a background from the Backgrounds.md document in Character_Creation
backgrounds are the most basic unit of lore for your character, simply
describing their occupation before they experienced the call to adventuring.

### Choosing a Bodytype
Next, choose a bodytype from the BodyTypes.md document in Character_Creation.
Body types change your size and give you certain attributes related to your 
physicality as well as giving you a modifier to your stats.

#### VARIANT RULE: Choosing Skills
Rather than ending at choosing a bodytype you may choose 2 skills to have
proficiency in. Proficiency is an additional modifier that you may add to
your d20 skill check or any other check you are proficient in. Your proficiency 
bonus as a commoner is 1.

#### VARIANT RULE: Choosing Class at Start
Rather than ending at choosing a bodytype you may choose a class from the
Character_Creation folder and begin at a level permitted by your GMs in that 
class.


## Classes
Your class is your specialization as a character, giving you special abilities
which allow you to brave battle and roleplay. If your GM is not using the 
variant rule "Choosing Class at Start" then you will be starting without a class.


## Non-Player Characters
Non-player characters (NPCs) are characters created and played by the GM that
the player characters (PCs) are capable of interacting with. An evil monster is 
an NPC just the same as a friendly villager is an NPC.

# Combat
In most tales of adventure there will eventually be more... hostile encounters,
these combat rules are meant to help orgainize those encounters.


## Initiative Count
When combat begins every combatant will roll 1d20, adding their dexterity 
modifier to the roll, this will henceforth be referred to as the respective
combatant's "initiative". Initiative determines how soon you take your turn 
after combat begins with higher being sooner. If two combatants roll the same 
initiative the combatant with the higher dexterity score will go first. If this 
does not resolve the issue then both combatants will roll 1d20 and the combatant 
with the higher roll will go first.

## Armor Class
Armor class is your ability to resist attacks, to determine armor class refer
to the armor you have equipped. If you have no armor equiped your AC is equal to
10 + Your Dexterity Modifier, some features and traits may alter your base AC.

## Capabilities on Your Turn
You are capable of performing the following on your turn:

- 1 action (attacking, dodging, etc.)
- 1 bonus action (special actions)
- Moving (a distance up to your movement speed)
- 1 free object interaction (picking up an item, pulling a lever, etc.)

### Actions on Your Turn
on your turn you are capable of taking many different actions, some of the most
common ones are listed here:

- Attack: Make one melee or attack against another creature. 
- Cast A Spell: You may cast a spell which you know and has a casting time of
one action.
- Grapple: You make a grapple contest against one creature
- Dodge: You spend your action readying against incoming attacks. You gain
advantage on dexterity checks and all attacks made from an enemy that you see 
have disadvantage.
- Disengage: You disengage making it so that creatures cannot make an attack of
oppurtunity against you for walking outside of their melee range.
- Dash: You dash, doubling your movement speed for this turn.
- Help: You may help another creature, giving them advantage on their next roll,
additionally you may use this action to distract an enemy giving the next attack
against them advantage.
- Hide: Provided you are out of sight you may hide behind cover
- Ready: You prepare an action with a specific trigger, using your reaction to
act when the conditions are met.
- Aid: You may attempt to medically aid one creature within 5 feet of you, roll
a medicine check, on a 16 or higher their health becomes 0 and they are 
stabilized

#### Making an attack
When you make an attack, roll 1d20 and add the associated modifiers to the roll.
The goal of this roll is to roll above the AC of your target. If your roll beats
the AC of your target the attack hits.

##### Attack Damage
When an attack hits roll damage for that attack, roll the size and number of 
dice specified by the weapon or ability and add the applicable ability modifier
unless the weapon or ability states otherwise.

#### Casting a Spell
When casting a spell as an action, refer to the spell's listing in the spell
compendium and follow the instructions listed. Spell will reference many
parameters as shorthand, the full explainations are as follows:

##### Spell Range
For a spell to target a creature or object it must be within the spell's range
spell range is expressed as a flat distance.

##### Components
Nearly all spells require either Verbal (the ability to spealk) or Somatic 
(the ability to move your body) components but some higher level spells may 
require expensive Material components. You cannot cast a spell without the 
relatant components. 

##### Duration 
Duration refers to the length of time the spell takes place over. Instantaneous
spells have no duration as they happen in a single instant, but concentration 
spells take effect for a specific amount of time or until you choose to end them
(in some cases). Certain spells will have a duration but not require 
concentration

###### Breaking Concentration
You may break concentration to end a concentration spell at any time as a free
action. Concentration also ends if you fall unconcious or are incapacitated or
killed. If you take damage while concentrating on a spell make a will roll to
maintain concentration with the DC being 8 + the damage sustained or half the
damage sustained, whichever is higher, On a failure your concentration ends.

##### Targets
Targets describe who you may make the spell take effect on, often specifying 
a creature, object, or area of effect.

#### Area of effect
Certain spells will exhert an effect over a wide area, the description of these
areas is as follows: 

##### Cone
A cone extends in a direction you choose from wherever the spell specifies its
point of origin. At any point throughout a cone it's width is equal to distance 
from the point of origin. A cone's area of effect is determined by its distance.

##### Cube
You select a cube's point of origin, which is anywhere on a face of the cubic
effect. The cube's area of effect is the length of each side.

##### Cylinder

A cylinder's point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius,
as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at
the height of the spell effect.

##### Line
A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and
covers an area defined by its width.

##### Sphere
You select a sphere's point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that
point. The sphere's size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the
point.

#### Mana and Will Rolls in Spellcasting.
You may sometimes encounter life or death situations where you need to push your
spellcasting abilities to the limits, this is what the will and mana skills are
for. 

##### Mana 
When you cast a spell you may push your ability to the limit, roll a Mana skill
check and the GM will use their discretion to apply special effects to the 
spell. You must ask your GM before attempting to perform this

##### Will
When you are out of spellcasting ability (ex: grace for a priest) you are unable
to cast spells, unless your GM allows you to will them into working temporarily.
Make a will skill check, on a 16 or higher you may cast a first or second level
spell taking one or two points of damage respectively.

#### Grapple
You make an athletics check against one creature within 5 feet of you which the 
target may contest with either athletics or acrobatics, the target may be no 
more than one size larger than you. On a failure they are grappled. You have
disadvantage on grappling creatures larger than you.

#### Hide
You attempt to hide, making a stealth check against the passive perception of
every combatant who saw you in your previous location, on a success you are
hidden behind full cover.

## Hitpoints
Hitpoints are a measure of your physical wellbeing and consciousness. When your
hitpoints drop to 0 or lower you fall unconcious. If you have 0 or fewer 
hitpoints on your turn you must expend a hit dice and regain an amount of 
hitpoits equal to your roll, if you are at 0 hitpoints and have no hit dice on 
the start of your turn you die.

### VARIANT RULE: Conscious At No Health
Rather than passing out immediatly at 0 or fewer hitpoints you may make a health
roll against half the damage you sustained or 8 + the damage sutained
(whichever is higher) on a success you remain standing. Repeat this roll at the
start of each of your turns, you fall unconcious and begin dying on a failure.

### Damage
When you sustain damage remove the amount of damage you took from your current
hitpoints

### Temporary Hitpoints
Temporary hitpoints disappear after an hour unless specified otherwise and are 
granted by a multitude of features and spells, if you take damage and have
temporary hitpoints, subtract the damage from your temporary hitpoints with the
remaining damage effecting your regular hitpoints.

### Damage Resistance
Certain features and armors may grant a damage resistance number or a damage 
type resistance. For resistance numbers simply subtract the resistance amount
from physical damage sustained. For damage type resistances simply half the
amount of damage dealt by that damage type.

## Stagger
Certain weapons and attacks may stagger, when targeted by an attack that
staggers the target must make a health roll against half the damage sustained or 
8 + the damage sutained (whichever is higher). On a failed save, they have 
disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and can't take reactions, until
the end of your next turn.

# Adventuring
Adventuring is the core of the game! seeing places, meeting interestig people 
and killing them! Here are the guidlines for adventuring:

## Resting and Sustained living
As a mortal being you will require rest and certain amenities during that rest,
for each amenity you satisfy you will regain a hit die during a rest. You may
also expend hit dice during a rest to regain hitpoints. A rest spans over 8 
hours during which you sleep for at least 6 hours and engage in light activity 
for the remaining time.

### Amenities
the amenities are as follows:

- Pound of food
- Liter of drink
- Bed
- Fire
- Shelter
- Extra pound of food
- Extra liter of drink
- Comfortable bed
- Medical aid
- High quality medical aid

## Going Without
For every day you go without either food, drink, or sleep you lose access to
2 of your maximum hit dice, dying when the maximum reaches 0.

## Special Cases
Certain features will free you from needing food, drink, and sleep. In these
cases simply count those amenities as automatically fulfilled, unless stated
otherwise.
