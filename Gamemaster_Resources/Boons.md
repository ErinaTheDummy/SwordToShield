Boons are special features granted to players by GMs, Boons are often given as
rewards from NPCs. A feat may also be a boon, but a boon must never be a feat,
boons should always be earned through merit rather than simply leveling up.

### Boon of Truesight
You are capable of seeing the world for all it truly is. As a free action you 
may cast detect magic, illusions have no effect on you, and invisible creatures
are visible to you. Darkness has no effect on your ability to see, magical or
otherwise.

### Boon of Strength
Your strength score increases by 4

### Boon of Immortaility
You no longer age and cannot die of old age.

### Boon of Invincibility
When you take damage that would kill you or reduce you to or below 0 hitpoints,
you may expend a hit die to take 0 damage instead.

you allow yourself to be inflicted with it.

### Boon of The Giant

### Boon of Critical Damage

roll the damage dice a second time and deal that damage in addition to the 
original damage

### Boon of The Dragon

of elemental energy in a direction of your choice. All creatures in the area of

damage type your GM chooses.

regain maximum hitpoints from healing spells and effects such as rolling hit
dice while resting. Effects such as the beacon of hope spell double the healing
you recieve. Each time you complete a rest you may expend and roll a hit die, 
increasing your maximum hit die by amount rolled until the end of your next 
rest.
