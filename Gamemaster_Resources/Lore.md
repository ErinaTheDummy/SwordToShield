## Gods and Goddesses
Across the realms there are many gods. These gods preside over the domains that
were created as they were created. The gods are listed in order of creation, 
with their status next to their name.

### An'Ire - Greater
An'Ire (An-Eye-Er), Considered by most as the eldest of the gods, is the goddess
of creation and invention. She is the patron of inventors and artists across 
existance. She holds a deep love for all creations, even those that are not her 
own. She is known from time to time to strike inventors and artists with 
inspiration for great works and she grants a boon of golem creation onto her 
high priests. Most high priests of An'Ire are women who are mothers or artists. 
Her holy symbol is a hand holding a tool.

### Death - Greater
Death, although not technically a god, is just as powerful as one. Death 
oversees the passage of all mortal things. Death is as old as An'Ire, but is
speculated by some to be older. The symbol of death is a scythe or a skull. 
Death does not take warlocks or priests, and remains completely neutral in 
almost all matters except when it amuses him. Death's Legion of reapers however,
often take a more active approach and siphon his power to warlocks and priests
who worship him.

### Maldrin - Greater
Maldrin (Mal-drin) is a god gone rogue against the order of the heavens. Maldrin 
appears in a form best suited to persuade those he meets, Appearing as a red, 
goat legged, horned devil to fiends, a mass of tentacles and teeth to 
mostrosities and a radiant being of light and beauty to Humanoids. Maldrin's 
primary directive is to spread pain, and fear, and sow destruction. He was cast 
from the heavens and hid under creation as his brothers, just as evil as he, 
were slaughtered by An'Ire. Because of this, he holds a grudge against all her 
creation, and would destroy them in an instant if given the chance. Maldrin has 
many holy symbols with his most prominent ones being a hand holding a sword, and
a crown of thorns lined with jewels.

### Astraía - Greater
Astraía (Es-tray-uh) is the goddess of space and magic, Created along with her 
sister Eos when An'Ire created the prime material realm. She is often worshiped
by those who travel across the farlands, the abyss, and the void in hopes of 
safe passage. Her holy symbol a 4 pointed star.

### Eos - Greater
Eos (ay-os) is the goddess of time. She is tasked with ensuring that time 
continues to move as normal. She watches over the sands of time, counting every 
grain as they fall. Eos is worshiped by those who wish to live long fulfilling 
lives. Her holy symbol is an hourglass.

### Naturalia - Greater
Naturalia (Natur-al-ya) is the goddess of nature. She presides over the wildlife 
of the planets. She was created by An'Ire when An'Ire brought life and the 
worlds into being. She is worshiped by those who seek to protect nature and the 
natural order of life, she often takes warlocks and empowers priests during 
times when the natural order is threatened. Her holy symbol is a sprouting seed 
with three leaves, representing birth, life, and death.

### Helios - Greater
Helios is the god of the sun and light. He is also occasionally worshipped as a
war deity due to his constant conflict with luno, the god of the moon. His holy
symbol is the sun. He is the child of Eos and An'Ire. 

### Luno - Greater
Luno is the god of the moon and peace. He is engaged in a constant conflict with
the sun god helios, constalty bickering with him whether the world should be 
shrouded in night or day. He is the child of An'Ire and Astraía. His holy symbol
is the moon.

### Themius - Greater
Themius is the god of justice and law. He was created from the tears An'Ire
wept when she cast out the Leviathans. Themius created all the orders of angels
and commands them in accordance with the will of the other gods. Themius has
impartial judgement but he wishes to see good prevail, making him good rather
than neutral. His holy symbol is a scale, slightly tipped to the right. 

### Valyria - Greater
Valyria (Val-eye-ree-a) is the goddess of love and war. She was created by 
An'Ire as a balance to Themius, and to aid him in lording over the angels. She 
is the advocate for those who commit crimes or injustices under pretenses that 
make their actions more acceptable, especially love and war. She holds a slight 
distain for men, but does not allow this to sway her partiality. Her followers 
are known to say "All is fair through her". Her holy symbol is a heart with a 
sword plunged through the center from the top and thorns wrapped around it.

### The Fates - Greater
The fates are three gods who control the order of events within the universe. 
The fates are a collection of three sisters, who came about from nothing when
Valyria was created. The sisters of fate are Providince, Destiny, and Will. They
are neutral dieties who preside over the thread of fate, but they often bicker
with how it should be handled. Destiny Draws the string of fate, providince
guides it from its spindle, and Will cuts it. Their holy symbol is a spindle or
golden thread.

### Sinira - Greater
Sinira (Sin-eye-ra) is the goddess of pain and endurance. Sinira Is the avatar 
of An'Ire. While technically the same god, her religious doctrine was largely 
shaped by the human experience, rather than by divine mind; Due to this her 
doctrine holds true to values of the sanctity of life and the defense of it as 
well as the inherent holiness of suffering for one another as it is a distinctly
human act. Her holy symbol is a dagger cracked in half along the blade.
