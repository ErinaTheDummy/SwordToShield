## Gods and Goddesses
Across the realms there are many gods. These gods preside over the domains that were created as they were created. The gods are listed in order of creation, with their status next to their name.

### An'Ire
Greater Deity

Feminine Presence

Domains: Creation, Invention, Life

Posture: Warm, welcoming, and forgiving, like any good, kind mother 

Symbol: A hand holding a tool

An'Ire (An-Eye-Er), Considered by most as the eldest of the gods, is the goddess of creation and invention. She is the patron of inventors and artists across existence. She holds a deep love for all creations, even those that are not her own. She is known from time to time to strike inventors and artists with inspiration for great works and she grants a boon of Golem creation onto her high priests. Most high priests of An'Ire are women who are mothers or artists.

### Mortis
Greater Deity

Masculine Presence

Domains: Death, Law, Peace

Posture: Emotionally neutral, but startling kind, with a sense of humor. 

Symbol: A scythe or a skull.

Mortis oversees the passage of all mortal things. Mortis is as old as An'Ire, but is speculated by some to be older. Mortis does not take warlocks or priests, and remains completely neutral in almost all matters except when it amuses him. Mortis' Legion of reapers however, often take a more active approach and siphon his power to warlocks and priests who worship him.

### Maldrin
Greater Deity (Forgotten, Dead)\
Androgynous Presence\
Domains: Deceit, Freedom, Power\
Posture: Deceitful and cunning, willing to do anything to undo creation.\
Symbol: a hand holding a sword or a crown of thorns lined with jewels. Various others exist as well, ranging from
imitating the symbols of other gods to being entirely unique.

Maldrin (Mal-drin) was a god gone rogue against the order of the heavens. Maldrin's primary directive was to spread pain, and fear, and sow destruction. He was cast from the heavens and hid under creation; as his allies and corrupt-ors, The Leviathans, were sealed away by An'Ire. Because of his unique relationship with the primordial leviathans, he held a grudge against all of An'Ire's creations, and would have destroyed them in an instant if he was given the chance. Maldrin appeared in any form best suited to persuade those he met, Appearing as a red, goat legged, horned devil to fiends, a mass of tentacles and teeth to monstrosities, a radiant being of light and beauty to Humanoids, in addition to many other forms.

Maldrin's campaign against the material world ended after he formed a coalition between demons and devils to attack the heavens. For thousands of years he commanded an endless horde against the heavens, before being thwarted by a Coinneach spawn. At the end of the millenniums long siege, he was captured by An'ire. With heavy heart she locked him alongside his old friends, The Leviathans, in the deepest depths of the never ending Abyss.

Feeling cornered and caged, Maldrin mistook An'Ire's mercy for a temporary holding. Thinking he would be put to death, he tore himself into seven pieces to slip through his chains, and out of the bars of his cage. Maldrin did not entirely survive this act, but the seven pieces left behind grew into lesser gods of their own. Each piece took on a singular of his beguiling disguises, and they all went their separate ways. Each one of these lesser gods had no memory of being Maldrin, nor did they see each other as family or even equals, their evil nature undoing any hope for Maldrin's efforts. 

### Skotos
Lesser Deity (Unknown)
Feminine Presence
Domains: Deceit, Freedom, Wealth
Posture: Outwardly humorous and agreeable, but secretly smug and detesting 
Symbol: A hand holding a shield

With the appearance of a beautiful human woman that has long flowing white hair, any one of thousands of facial arrangements and complexions, flowing golden robes, and graceful wings like those of a dove, it is forgivable that Skotos could be mistaken for an angel or goddess of light. Although shrouded in folds of light, her intentions are entirely impure. Her harmonic, harp-like voice only serving as a tool to deceive. Skotos is the patron deity of all those who harbor such greed that they justify any means to satiate it. She often makes one-sided deals with humanoids, tricking them into giving up years of their life to heal loved ones, or parts of their souls and a bit of their luck for everlasting life.  

### Bishu
Lesser Deity (Unknown)
Masculine Presence
Domains: Conquest, Vengeance, War, Forge

### Coinneach 

Greater Deity (Forgotten)
Masculine Presence 
Domains: Rot, Death, Rebirth 
Posture: Silent and mysterious, seeks to bring rot to all aspects of reality. 
Symbol: A birds eye pendant of a wasp or the side profile of a striking cobra.

Coinneach (Coin-neck) is a son of Mortis, conceived upon An'Ire's creation of life, specifically nature. 

Though his father is a principled entity, Coinneach took joy in spreading rot to An'Ire's creations. He quickly grew into his godhood, experimenting with different ways that he could tamper with Creation. Mortis tried to steer him into a righteous path, pushing him to be an antithesis to life rather than an antagonist, but Coinneach was ultimately unswayed by the gesture. He was seemingly jealous of An'Ire and her ability to create, while he was only able to destroy. 

Coinneach's experiments ultimately culminated in the creations of deadly diseases and plagues that struck humanity like a hammer. He also grew to twist An'Ire's creations into something of his own making or design; elongating worms and creating snakes, or corrupting bees to create wasps. This birthed the idea of the “predator”, when before all creatures lived in harmony. 

Eventually, An'Ire grew tired of Coinneach’s antics. Although, unintentionally, his abominations had brought balance to her realms, it had also brought chaos. Notably, his creations of plagues spread farther than he ever imagined and nearly began a culling of humanity. 

With a heavy heart, Coinneach’s father and An'Ire schemed to seal him away in a pocket of The Abyss, where An'Ire had thrown away The Leviathans millenniums prior. Although they were successful, Coinneach being sealed left a curse on the Realms. Every plant was cursed to wither away eventually, every weak prey would be hunted by a stronger predator, and death would no longer always be peaceful. His form was sealed, but his plagues and rot persisted just through his pure hatred for An'Ire and Mortis. Coinneach’s curse would eventually sprout his own “children” or deities, patron gods of War, Pestilence and Famine. 

Since being sealed, Coinneach has been known to take Warlocks or Chosen in an effort to slither his way out of the Abyss. His reach though, is weak, so it does not amount to much due to the fact that he can only supply a few at a time with his abilities.

### Astraía - Greater

impartial judgment but he wishes to see good prevail, making him good rather than neutral. His holy symbol is a scale, slightly tipped to the right. 

### Valyria - Greater

### Sinira (Lesser)
