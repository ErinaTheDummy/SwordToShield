## Gods and Goddesses
Across the realms there are many gods. These gods preside over the domains that
were created as they were created. The gods are listed in order of power, with
their status next to their name

### An'Ire - Greater
An'Ire (An-Eye-Er), The oldest of the gods, is the goddess of creation and 
invention. She is the patron of inventors and artists across existance. She 
holds a deep love for all creations, even those that are not her own. She is 
known from time to time to strike inventors and artists with inspiration for 
great works and she grants a boon of golem creation onto her high priests. Most
high priests of An'Ire are women who are mothers or artists. Her holy symbol
is a hand holding a tool.

### Death - Greater
Death, although not technically a god, is just as powerful as one. Death 
oversees the passage of all mortal things. Death is as old as An'Ire, but is
speculated by some to be older. The symbol of death is a scythe or a skull. 
Death does not take warlocks or priests, and remains completely neutral in 
almost all matters except when it amuses him. Death's Legion of reapers however,
often take a more active approach and siphon his power to warlocks and priests
who worship him.

### Maldrin - Greater
Maldrin is a god gone rogue against the order of the heavens. Maldrin appears in
a form best suited to persuade those he meets, Appearing as a red, goat legged,
horned devil to fiends, a mass of tentacles and teeth to mostrosities and a
radiant being of light and beauty to humans. Maldrin's primary directive is to
spread pain, and fear, and sow destruction. He was cast from the heavens and
hid under creation as his brothers, just as evil as he, were slaughtered by 
An'Ire. Because of this, he holds a grudge against all her creation, and would
destroy them in an instant if given the chance. Maldrin has many holy symbols
with his most prominent ones being a hand holding a sword, and a crown of thorns
lined with jewels.

### Astraía - Greater

planets. She was created by An'Ire when An'Ire brought life and the worlds into 
being. She is worshiped by those who seek to protect nature and the natural
order of life, she often takes warlocks and empowers priests during times when
the natural order is threatened. Her holy symbol is a sprouting seed with three

than neutral. His holy symbol is a scale, slightly tipped to the right.

to Themius, and to aid him in lording over the angels. She is the advocate for
