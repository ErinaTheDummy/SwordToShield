From the angels and other servants of the gods to the gods themselves, 
celestials are beings of the heavens.

# Choirs of Angels
Angels are beings of pure good nature, their entire purpose is to serve the will
of the gods through direct and indirect means. There are 9 choirs of angels, 
with each choir having specific duties and responsibilities to the heavenly 
planes.

## Third Triad
The third triad is the collection of angels which largely deal with more 
granular humanoid matters.

### Lesser Angels
The most standard and first choir of angels, lesser angels are personal 
protectors, assigned to a specific person as a guardian spirit.

### Archangels
The second choir of angels, Archangels are intended to lead lesser angels about
the worlds.

### Principalities
The third choir of angels, Principalities are protectors of entire communities
or countries. They are often commanded by earthly kings who have been granted 
divine right to their names.  

## Second Triad
The second triad is the collection of angels who are meant to enact the grand 
design of the gods, defending the material planes against invaders and combating
the legions of the hells, abyss, and the void. 

### Powers
The fourth choir of angels, Powers are warrior angels, frontline foot soldiers 
in the endless battles of heaven and hell. Powers are the angels most likely to
take warlocks for the cause, sometimes doing so under false pretenses for the
greater good.
