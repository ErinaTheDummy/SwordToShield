Humanoids are intelligent beings, capable of creation, reason, and moral judgment,
created by the gods. Humanoids come in all sorts of shapes and sizes and may even
be capable of reproducing with non-Humanoids such as dragons. All offspring of 
Humanoids are equally Humanoid, just in a different flavor. 


### Commoners
Commoners are ordinary Humanoids with no interesting features or abilities outside
