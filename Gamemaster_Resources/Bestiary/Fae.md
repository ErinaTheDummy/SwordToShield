Fae are magical creatures of the natural world that range from spirits to 
physical beings. The one thing that rings true throughout all Fae is their knack
for trickery. 

## Hags
Hags are a powerful bunch of very powerful magic wielding tricksters. They are
characterized by their underhanded deals and their wicked true appearance. To
make a deal with any Fae is already foolish enough, to make a deal with a hag is
often suicide.

### Bog Hag
Bog hags preside in the most putrid swamps. Their true form is covered in a 
sickly, slimy, green skin and their wicked gaze is enough to drive some mad. Bog
hags are known to steal children away for dark rituals, or just for a quick 
snack.
