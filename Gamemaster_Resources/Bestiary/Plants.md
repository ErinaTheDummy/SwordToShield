Plants are creatures of branches, vines, and roots, rather than flesh, bone
and blood. Plants are a mixed bag of creatures of instinct and creatures of
intellect.

### Hydrageas
Hydrageas are a large, flower like creature. They often lay in wait pretending
to be mutated hydrangea before striking and consuming their prey. They have 
three flowering heads with gaping maws, and multiple false heads. Their 
regenerative rate is so fast that they often grow back one of their heads 
shortly after it is cut of, the source of their name and hydra parallels.
