Monstrosities are cruel and disgusting abominations brought on by magical corruption or the transmutation of two creatures. A sad truth is that a large amount of monstrosities are made through divine curse upon the wicked or at the hands of a maddened wizard looking for a perfect killing machine to serve their will. Other times monstrosities evolve alongside other creatures with the aid of magical acceleration, granting them more unique niches within a biome. 

## Abominations
Abomination is the sub-designation for monstrosities created through transmutation. All abominations were made by magic falling into unfortunate hands.

toxins of vipers. They have scaly hide resembling that of a python, and the body
structure of a wolf, with the tail of a cobra and the head and of a viper.
