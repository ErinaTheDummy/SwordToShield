Monstrosities are cruel and disgusting abominations brough on by magical 
corruption or the transmutation of two creatures. A sad truth is that most
monstrosities are made through divine curse upon the wicked or at the hands of a 
maddened wizard looking for a perfect killing machine to serve their will.

## Abominations
Abomination is the subdesignation for monstrosities created through 
transmuation. All abominations were made by magic falling into unforunate hands.

### Viper Wolves
Viper wolves were made with the perfect hunting ability of wolves and the deadly
toxins of vipers. They have scaly hide resembling that of a python, and the body
structure of a wolf, with the tail of a cobra and the head and of a viper.
