some are chaotic, some are orderly, some are evil beyond measure, and some 
measure their evil in quarterly reports. Fiends are all those beings which 
reside in the lower planes which are not leviathan. Demons and devils fall into
this category.

## Demons
Demons are beings of condensed chaos and destruction, created as a mockery to
An'ire's creation, they serve only to unmake all that is made.

### Globs
Globs are demons which appear like masses of rotten flesh and bones. They are
known to hunt by sticking to objects and jumping onto their prey, mocking them
all the while.  Globs are pack hunters due to their weak stature.

in a battle.
