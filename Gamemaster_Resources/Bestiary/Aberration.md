Aberrations are beings from, or created by creatures from, the farlands. 
Aberrations rarely have the intelligence to communicate, and even when they do
they often wish for destruction or consumption more than power.

## The Hive
These monsters are intended to be used together, they were created by a parasite
from the farlands, which often spreads through meteors from the farlands 
colliding with the world.

### Hive Drone
Hive drones are the workers of the Hive's colonies. They appear as tiny or small
insect-like humanoids with apposable hands. They can often be found within the
colony moving around eggs or tending to Hive Creatures who were harmed or are
still turning. Hive drones secrete a green mucus-like liquid which heightens the 
healing factor of creatures touched by it.

### Razorbacks
Razorbacks are the warriors of the Hive's colonies, disbatched anywhere where 
there is trouble. They appear as tall humanoid figure with a jagged metal 
structure along their back. They have no eyes and rely on hearing and smell to

metal structure on their back appear like the dorsal fin of a shark.

their heads at the entrance of the inner chambers of colonies, blocking most 
things from entering during times of emergency.

into healthy human hosts. The human hosts then transform into different kinds of

appearance, but they always remain bloodthirsty and set on destruction. 
Dreadbeasts are foreign to the prime material plane and wish to do nothing more 
than hunt and devour. Dreadbeasts are often told in stories as boogeyman-like 
figures, so their existance is often a topic of debate.
