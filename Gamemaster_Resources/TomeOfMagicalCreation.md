## Introduction
Across creation there are many materials imbued with magical properties. These
materials may be used in the creation of magical items, in the casting of 
spells, or for a variety of other applications. Magical materials range from
very rare and expensive to common and dirt cheap, according to your GM's vision 
for the setting.

### Adamantite
Adamantite is an indestructable black metal, found deep underground in perfectly
spherical deposits. Adamantite is harvested using Fire Dragonsteel tools which
are capable of making it plyable enough to section off and form into usable 
shapes. Adamantite is theorized to have no liquid form as nobody has thus far
been able to heat it to a tempurature hot enough to melt it.

### Mythril
Mythril is a platinum-gold colored metal, named for its rarity, as it is seen
by most as a metal only existing in myth. Mythril is a self healing material,
when broken it will swiftly return to the shape it was last cast into. Melting
mythril in acid is the only way to counteract its self healing properties. There
are myths in some lands that an elven king once commissioned an army of mythril
automaton, deathless and unrelenting in their fury.

### Azanite
Azanite is a dark red, matte metal almost crystaline in appearance. Azanite is
capable of amplifying magical fields and is thus a friend of many a wizard, 
warlock, and sorcerer alike. 

### Tulunium
Tulunium is a white iridescent metal, and almost transparent when thin. It is
incredibly lightweight and said to be created in the heart of stars. When 
extremely thin it is flexible like leather and is sometimes used in place of 
leather by the ultra wealthy.

### Dreadite
Dreadite is a glass-like, foggy, black metal. Dreadite is an alloy of Tulunium, 
Azanite and the coagulated blood of a dreadbeast. It is an extremely heavy metal
but it is capable of holding an edge better than even Adamantite, Allowing it to
be sharpened to ludicrous levels. Dreadite's unique ability to hold an edge is 
due to the fact that forces applied to it under a certain threshold temporarily 
harden the metal's structure.  

### Dragonsteel
Dragonsteel comes in many different varieties, as listed below:

- Fire Dragonsteel
- Ice Dragonsteel
- Acid Dragonsteel
- Poison Dragonsteel
- Lightning Dragonsteel
- Radiant Dragonsteel
- Rotten Dragonsteel

Dragonsteel functions the same as mundane steel in regards to hardness, color,
and general appearance. Dragonsteel diverts in that it was forged using the 
breath of a dragon capable of producing the associated element and that it has
special properties relating to that element. These properties include impervity 
or resistance to the associated element as well as production of the element 
naturally.  

### Radotonium
Known as Radotonium and Moonrock to inventors and commoners respectively. 
Radotonium is a soft, white, brittle metal that is easily ground into dust. It 
holds extremely magically corruptive properties, emmiting constant rays of 
corrupted mana, it is capable of corrupting those who stand around it in large 
quantities for too long or consume it. When crushed into a powder and consumed 
it causes a great euphoric feeling for the consumer. Radotonium may be compacted
and enriched with other magical metals in order to create an advanced energy 
source for inventors.

## Introduction
Throughout the lands there are various items which have been imbued with power
through sometimes... dark means. These items are known universally as magical
items, regardless of power. Magic items are divided by rarity, between common,
uncommon, rare, legendary, and artifact rarities.

### Common
Common magic items can be found most everywhere, they perform simple functions
and are often more for entertainment or simple utility rather than combat.

### Uncommon
Uncommon magic items are easily found in ancient structures, homes and dens
of magical beasts, and within the catalogues of magic item dealers. Uncommon
magic items often give an edge in battle or some form of enhanced ability to
the character who wields them.

### Rare
Rare magic items are... well... rare! they can be found in all the same places
as uncommon magic items but less so! Rare magic items are capable of enhancing
the ability of a character so much so that an average person would stand no 
chance compared to the abilities granted by the item.

### Legendary
Legendary items are the highest rarity of reproducable magic items. Legendary
items are seldom found outside of extremely well gaurded or buried lockups,
in the right hands legendary items can be used to slaughter dozens of people.

### Artifact
Artifacts are the enigmatic pinnacle of the limits of magical items. Artifacts
are special because each artifact exists as a singular thing, there can be no
two artifacts that are exactly alike or share strong similarities. Artifacts are
found in secret locations meant to seal them away for all of eternity, created
long ago, it was known that nobody could be trusted with such power. In the 
wrong hands artifacts could be used to bend entire countries to one's will and 
to even kill gods in some cases. Some artifacts have such a condensed amount of
magic within them that a corruptive effect is rendered upon those who so much as
stand near them.

## Attunement
Due to the great power that magical items may hold, some require you to 
familiarize yourself with them in order to utilize them, this is called 
attunement. You may only be attuned to three magic items at one time. The
time it takes to attune to a magic item is variable, based on rarity. Refer
to the following chart for attunement times:


```
|  Rarity   | Attunement Time |
| --------- | --------------- |
| Common    |  1 action       |
| Uncommon  |  1 minute       |
| Rare      |  1 rest (8hrs)  |
| Legendary |  1 day (24 hrs) |
| Artifact  |  Variable       |
| --------- | --------------- |
```
