## Introduction
Throughout the lands there are various items which have been imbued with power
through sometimes... dark means. These items are known universally as magical
items, regardless of power. Magic items are divided by rarity, between common,
uncommon, rare, legendary, and artifact rarities.

### Common
Common magic items can be found most everywhere, they perform simple functions
and are often more for entertainment or simple utility rather than combat.

### Uncommon
Uncommon magic items are easily found in ancient structures, homes and dens
of magical beasts, and within the catalogues of magic item dealers. Uncommon
magic items often give an edge in battle or some form of enhanced ability to
the character who wields them.

### Rare
Rare magic items are... well... rare! they can be found in all the same places
as uncommon magic items but less so! Rare magic items are capable of enhancing
the ability of a character so much so that an average person would stand no 
chance compared to the abilities granted by the item.

### Legendary
Legendary items are the highest rarity of reproducable magic items. Legendary
items are seldom found outside of extremely well gaurded or buried lockups,
in the right hands legendary items can be used to slaughter dozens of people.

### Artifact
Artifacts are the enigmatic pinnacle of the limits of magical items. Artifacts
are special because each artifact exists as a singular thing, there can be no
two artifacts that are exactly alike or share strong similarities. Artifacts are
found in secret locations meant to seal them away for all of eternity, created
long ago, it was known that nobody could be trusted with such power. In the 
wrong hands artifacts could be used to bend entire countries to one's will and 
to even kill gods in some cases. Some artifacts have such a condensed amount of
magic within them that a corruptive effect is rendered upon those who so much as
stand near them.

## Attunement
Due to the great power that magical items may hold, some require you to 
familiarize yourself with them in order to utilize them, this is called 
attunement. You may only be attuned to three magic items at one time. The
time it takes to attune to a magic item is variable, based on rarity. Refer
to the following chart for attunement times:

```
|  Rarity   | Attunement Time |
| --------- | --------------- |
| Common    |  1 action       |
| Uncommon  |  1 minute       |
| Rare      |  1 rest (8hrs)  |
| Legendary |  1 day (24 hrs) |
| Artifact  |  Variable       |
| --------- | --------------- |
```
