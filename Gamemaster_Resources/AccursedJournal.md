This journal holds documentation on various magical corruptions, diseases, parasites, and perhaps more...

## Curses
Bestowed through black magic or as holy retribution, curses limit the abilities of a character by granting heavy drawbacks or detrimental features.

### Malignant Shifting
You are inflicted with a kind of "-thropy" from the shifter class. You are only capable of performing unwilling shifts of that monstrous form type, lacking any control over yourself while turned.

### The Mark
You gain a mark somewhere on your body and it is bound to one weapon within your ownership. So long as the mark is upon your body you have an insatiable bloodlust relating to the bound weapon. Each time you feel the pull of the mark you must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or give in, performing as it wishes. You are also perpetually inflicted with the low status effect, except for when you are holding the bound weapon, until the curse is lifted. 

### Curse of Famine
You are perpetually hungry. You cannot benefit from any amenities related to consuming anything other than water. You do not starve, but you are in constant pain as if you were. 

### Plague of Frogs
Everywhere you go you are followed by swarms of frogs, making all terrain you step on difficult terrain. 

### Curse of Involuntary Speed
Your movement speed is doubled, but you are no longer capable of performing bonus actions, with bonus action spells and abilities requiring a full action.

### Curse of The Fallen
This curse is bestowed upon those who defy the orders and values of their god. You may no longer heal from healing spells such as cure wounds and you gain vulnerability to radiant and necrotic damage.


## Diseases
Diseases exist everywhere there can be people or animals, spreading on the wind and in bad water and slowly killing those unfortunate enough to encounter them. A character that has a constitution modifier of 9 or lower has a disease and is cured if their constitution raises to or above 10.

### Bogrot
A character with bogrot has a constitution score of 8 and disadvantage on constitution checks. Bogrot presents itself as black streaks in the veins of the infected, as well as hair loss and can be caught through bad water. When bogrot is cured the afflicted person's constitution score increases back to 10 or its original amount, whichever is higher.  

### Specklethorns
A character with specklethorns is covered in sharp prickly thorns. They have disadvantage on persuasion checks and may spread the infection to others who prick themselves on the thorns.

### Chives
A character with chives smells strongly of onions and their hair is replaced with the green stalks of a green onion. Characters infected with chives are vulnerable to fire damage.

### Coal Lung
A character with coal lung has their constitution score reduced to 6 and has disadvantage on constitution and strength checks. They often cough up black viscous liquid, which then transmits the disease.

### Dragonsbane
In order to be afflicted with dragonsbane a character usually must have scales. Dragonsbane presents as an infection underneath the scales that causes them to protrude out into hard nodules, exposing soft flesh underneath, these nodules may also form on the neck, disallowing breath weapon attacks from escaping. The afflicted creature's s AC is reduced by 4 and they are unable to use their breath weapon if they have one.

## Parasites
Through their travels, characters may encounter lifeforms that attach to hosts and extract nutrients from them causing disease-like symptoms. Some parasites are purely malignant while others may offer benefits alongside their symptoms.

### Skin Swimmers
Skin swimmers are tadpole sized fish which magically imprint to the surface of an afflicted creature's skin. When attached to a host they appear as multicolored koi tattoos that swim across the skin. Skin swimmers move along the skin of a host consuming scabs and various other dead cells, causing them to regain 1 less hitpoint per hit die when rolling health gained during a rest. When not attached to a host skin swimmers can be found in clear water ponds, lakes and various streams, appearing as colorful glowing koi fish.

### Quixlethroz Worm
Quixlethroz worms originate from a far off planet and subside on a chemical only found in humanoid hearts. When exposed to a humanoid, Quixlethroz worms will immediately jump for any obvious orifices or wounds attempting to slither their way into the bloodstream. Once inside the bloodstream Quixlethroz worms will hitch a ride on the natural blood flow in order to make their way to the heart. Once within the chambers of the heart the worms will attach to soft tissues and begin their feast. Make a DC 16 Constitution Saving throw every two days after the initial infection and refer to the chart for effects on the character.

Whenever you take magical damage from a spell you regain a number of mana, glyphs, grace, or other similar casting stat equivalent to half the level of the spell which damaged you (rounded up).

#### Hitpoint Increase (10)
Your hitpoints increase by 1d10 + your constitution modifier

#### Incorporeality (11)
As an action on your turn you may expend 1d4 (rolled before expending) hit dice and become incorporeal. While Incorporeal you are immune to all damage types except force and radiant, can pass through any barrier of nonmagical material, and you do not need to breathe. If you end your turn in the area of an object you take 20 force damage and are expelled to the nearest empty location. You may become corporeal again as an action.  

#### Absorption (12)
If you are immune to a damage type you regain hitpoints equal to the damage you would take if you were not immune when you are targeted by an effect that deals that damage type.

#### Hyper Regeneration (13)
At the start of each of your turns you regain 1d8 + your constitution modifier hitpoints.

```
| Roll (1d4) | Creature     |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| 1          | Angel        |
| 2          | Devil        |
| 3          | Spider Queen |
| 4          | Undead Lord  |
```

#### Immortality (15)
The parts of your genes responsible for aging become corrupted, stopping you from ever aging again by magical or natural means.

#### Altered Time Rate (16)
Your body is disrupted by corrupted mana, separating you from standard time. On your turn you gain an additional action, your movement speed is doubled, and you may make investigation or perception checks to spot something as a free action rather than as an action. Everyone around you seems to move in half speed, and you seem to move in double speed to everyone around you.

#### Healthy Minded (17)
Your wisdom and intelligence scores both increase by 3

#### Irresistible beauty (18)
Your appearance alters to be that of a typically attractive person of your build and stature. Your charisma score increases by 4. People attracted to you are more likely to help you when you ask. 

#### Supernatural Durability (19)
Your soul is tightly bound to your body. You do not fall unconscious from falling to or below 0 hitpoints, and only die if your total damage taken puts you into -2 * your max hp. You should still make death saving throws at or below 0 hitpoints, but you only die if you fail 3 continuous death saves.

#### Extra Life (20)
When you die you get a second chance at life. Upon dying roll 1d4 for the method of your second chance.

```
|  Roll (1d4)  |  Method                                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1           |  A plant grows from your corpse. In 1d4 days a physical copy of you |
|              |  grows from this plant with all the same features and class levels  |
|              |  This copy of you has the "Plant" creature type and you control it. |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  2           |  You quickly regenerate and your fatal wounds are closed. Your      |
|              |  hitpoints return to full and your hit dice are restored. You lose  |
|              |  any curses or negative corruptions you had also.                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  3           |  Your soul jumps to the body of another creature of the same type   |
|              |  as you within the same plane you died on. You retain any features  |
|              |  unrelated to your physical build and your body becomes that of the |
|              |  creature.                                                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  4           |  You wake up 1d4 days later in the nearest calm body of fresh water,|
|              |  completely safe and intact, as the moon glows overhead.            |
|              |                                                                     |
