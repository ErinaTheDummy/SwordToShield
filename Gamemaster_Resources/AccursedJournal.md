This journal holds documentation on various magical corruptions, diseases,
parasites, and perhaps more...

## Curses
Bestowed through black magic or as holy retribution, curses limit the abilities
of a character by granting heavy drawbacks or detrimental features.

### Malignant Shifting
You are inflicted with a kind of "-thropy" from the shifter class. You are only
capable of performing unwilling shifts of that monstrous form type, lacking any
control over yourself while turned.

### The Mark
You gain a mark somewhere on your body and it is bound to one weapon within your
ownership. So long as the mark is upon your body you have an insatiable 
bloodlust relating to the bound weapon. Each time you feel the pull of the mark
you must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or give in, performing as it wishes.
You are also perpetually inflicted with the low status effect, except for when
you are holding the bound weapon, until the curse is lifted. 

### Curse of Famine
You are perpetually hungry. You cannot benefit from any ammenities related to
consuming anything other than water. You do not starve, but you are in constant
pain as if you were. 

### Plague of Frogs
Everywhere you go you are followed by swarms of frogs, making all terrain you 
step on difficult terrain. 

### Curse of Involuntary Speed
Your movement speed is doubled, but you are no longer capable of performing 
bonus actions, with bonus action spells and abilities requiring a full action.

### Curse of The Fallen
This curse is bestowed upon those who defy the orders and values of their god.
You may no longer heal from healing spells such as cure wounds and you gain 
vulnerability to radiant and necrotic damage.


## Diseases
Diseases exist everywhere there can be people or animals, spreading on the wind
and in bad water and slowly killing those unfortunate enough to encounter them.
A character that has a constitution modifier of 9 or lower has a disease and is
cured if their constitution raises to or above 10.

### Bogrot
A character with bogrot has a constitution score of 8 and disadvantage on 
constitution checks. Bogrot presents itself as black streaks in the veins of the 
infected, as well as hair loss and can be caught through bad water. When bogrot
is cured the afflicted person's constitution score increases back to 10 or its 
original amount, whichever is higher.  

### Specklethorns
A character with specklethorns is covered in sharp prickly thorns. They have
disadvantage on persuasion checks and may spread the infection to others who
pick themselves on the thorns.

### Chives
A character with chives smells strongly of onions and their hair is replaced 
with the green stalks of a green onion. Characters infected with chives are 
vulnerable to fire damage.

### Coal Lung
A character with coal lung has their constitution score reduced to 6 and has 
disadvantage on constitution and strength checks. They often cough up black 
viscious liquid, which then transmits the disease.

### Dragonsbane
In order to be afflicted with dargonsbane a characer usually must have scales. 
Dragonsbane presents as an infecton underneath the scakes that causes them to
protrude out into hard nodules, exposing soft flesh underneath, these nodules 
may also form on the neck, disallowing breath weapon attacks from escaping. The 
afflicted's AC is reduced by 4 and they are unable to use their breathweapon if 
they have one.

## Parasites
Throught their travels, characters may encounter lifeforms that attach to hosts
and extract nutrients from them causing disease-like symptoms. Some parasites
are purely malignant while others may offer benefits alongside their symptoms.

### Skin Swimmers
Skin swimmers are tadpole sized fish which magically imprint to the surface of
an afflicted creature's skin. When attached to a host they appear as 
multicolored koi tattoos that swim across the skin. Skin swimmers move along the
skin of a host consuming scabs and various other dead cells, causing them to
regain 1 less hitpoint per hit die when rolling health gained during a rest. 
When not attached to a host skin swimmers can be found in clear water ponds, 
lakes and various streams, appearing as colorful glowing koi fish.

### Quixlethroz Worm
Quixlethroz worms originate from a far off planet and subside on a chemical only 
found in humanoid hearts. When exposed to a humanoid, Quixlethroz worms will
immediately jump for any obvious orifaces or wounds attempting to slither their 
way into the bloodstream. Once inside the bloodstream Quixlethroz worms will
hitch a ride on the natural bloodflow in order to make their way to the heart.
Once within the chambers of the heart the worms will attach to soft tissues and
begin their feast. Make a DC 16 Constitution Saving throw and refer to the chart
for affects on the character.
