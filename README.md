# SwordToShield


## Intro
Hello dear reader! You may be wondering what this project is well, this github
repo serves as an area for me to collect some tabletop RPG mechanics for a
larger system I have dubbed "Sword To Shield" or STS for short. This project
is open source and you are free to borrow or modify anything written here.

## Disclaimer
This system is by no means balanced, and often is completely broken at times.
if you notice something working in a weird way or something that seems 
exploitable please bring it up to me.

## Well what is a "Sword to Shield" Erina?
Sword to shield is a TTRPG (Short for tabletop role playing game) which is a
sort of role playing game that runs in a collective conscience rather than as a
computer program on thinking rocks. I am largely making this system for my own
purposes so it is not expected to be widely distributed and it may be severely
lacking in explicit rules.

## Why are you hosting it on github?
Its easy.
