# SwordToShield


## Intro
Hello dear reader! You may be wondering what this project is well, this github
repo serves as an area for me to collect some tabletop RPG mechanics for a
larger system I have dubbed "Sword To Shield" or STS for short. This project
is open source and you are free to borrow or modify anything written here.

## Disclaimer
This system is based on another system named unchained worlds which shares many
philosophies with this system, if you stumble upon this system and enjoy it,
[give UW a try aswell](https://github.com/blukatdevelopment/UnchainedWorlds)
